00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.260
- It is the most important
right that Americans have.

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:07.560
It's not a coincidence or an accident

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.243
that it's named in the First
Amendment to the Constitution.

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.650
Without it, no democratic
society can be democratic,

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:17.483
for long.

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.000
And I'm an absolutist.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.627
That is, I believe that, for
example, people say to me,

00:00:25.627 --> 00:00:28.140
"But what about hate speech?"

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.320
Well, hate speech is much more
important than love speech,

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.440
and the reason is, I'm much
more interested in knowing

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.170
whom I should not turn my back on,

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.893
than I am interested in
figuring out who loves me.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.020
- The following is a conversation
with Harvey Silverglate,

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.140
a legendary free speech
advocate, co-founder of FIRE,

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.720
the Foundation for Individual
Rights and Expression,

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.790
and the author of several books

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:56.460
on the freedom of speech
and criminal justice,

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.980
including "The Shadow University:

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.400
The Betrayal of Liberty
on America's Campuses".

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.790
Harvey is running to be on
the Harvard Board of Overseers

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.340
this year with a write-in campaign,

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.500
so you have to spell his name correctly.

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.210
Silverglate.

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.550
Promising to advocate for free speech

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.040
and to push for reducing the size

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.590
of Harvard's administration bureaucracy.

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.940
Election is over this Tuesday,
May 16th at 5:00 PM Eastern.

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:26.580
To vote, you have to be Harvard alumni.

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.520
So, if you happen to be
one, please vote online.

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.440
It's a good way to
support freedom of speech

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.210
on Harvard campus.

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.900
Instructions how to do so
are in the description.

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.940
As a side note, please allow me to say

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:42.300
that since there are several
controversial conversations

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.010
coming up, I tried to make sure

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:47.400
that this podcast is a
platform for free discourse,

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.040
where ideas are not
censored, but explored,

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.050
and if necessary, challenged,

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:54.660
in a thoughtful, empathetic way.

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:57.090
It's by having such
difficult conversations,

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.233
not by avoiding them,

00:01:58.233 --> 00:02:01.500
that we can begin to heal
divides and to shed lights

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.370
on the dark parts of human
history and human nature.

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:07.410
This is the Lex Fridman Podcast.

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:09.480
To support it, please
check out our sponsors

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:11.490
in the description, and now,

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:14.763
dear friends, here's Harvey Silverglate.

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:16.920
You co-founded

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.950
the Foundation for Individual
Rights and Expression,

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.690
also known as FIRE.

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.490
A legendary organization that fights

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:25.500
for the freedom of
speech for all Americans

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.730
in our courtrooms, on our
campuses and in our culture.

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.590
So, let's start with a big question.

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.690
What is freedom of speech?

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.040
- First of all, the organization
when I co-founded it,

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.610
in 1999,

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.010
was called the Foundation
for Individual Rights

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.093
in Education.

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.410
It focused on

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.160
free speech issues on
college campuses in academia.

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.660
And only earlier this year did
we decide to expand our reach

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.720
beyond the campuses,
which is why the name,

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.630
although the acronym, FIRE, remains,

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:05.850
it's now the Foundation for Individual

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:07.710
Rights and Expression.

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:09.240
- [Lex] The E used to be education.

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:12.240
- E used to be education,
it's now expression.

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:15.627
And we basically do a lot of
the cases the ACLU used to do.

00:03:15.627 --> 00:03:20.627
The ACLU now, they're a
progressive organization,

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.120
rather than a civil
liberties organization.

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:29.130
And we've taken the role
of dealing with free speech

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.680
in the society generally,

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.963
and now this is a particularly,

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.803
and you are prone to censorship.

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:42.090
Everybody thinks they're right
and that people who disagree

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.240
with them should not be
able to voice their views.

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:46.950
It's a very difficult period right now,

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:49.053
both on campus and off campus.

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:54.420
It's about as intolerant
an era as I can remember.

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.340
I'm gonna be 81, May 10th.

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.730
I was born on Mother's Day, 1942.

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:02.190
And I can't remember it being this bad.

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:04.593
I was born during the McCarthy era.

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.490
- [Lex] So that says a lot.

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:10.980
- It sort of reminds me of that.

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.520
- Well, let's start with almost
a philosophical question,

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.590
a legal question, a human question.

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:19.470
What is this freedom that
you care so much about

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:21.900
that you fought for so
much, freedom of speech?

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:26.130
- It is the most important
right that Americans have.

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:29.430
It's not a coincidence or an accident

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:34.113
that it's named in the First
Amendment to the Constitution.

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:37.320
Without it, no democratic society

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:39.183
can be democratic for long.

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:42.870
And I'm an absolutist.

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:47.497
That is, I believe that, for
example, people say to me,

00:04:47.497 --> 00:04:50.010
"But what about hate speech?"

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:53.190
Well, hate speech is much more
important than love speech,

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:56.310
and the reason is, I'm much
more interested in knowing

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:59.010
whom I should not turn my back on,

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:01.920
than I am interested in figuring out

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:03.993
who loves me or who likes me.

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:08.790
So, hate speech is most
important, in my view,

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:12.390
and yet, it's banned in,
for example, schools.

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:13.653
It's unbelievable.

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:18.270
Kids are not schooled into

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:21.720
understanding the glory
of the First Amendment,

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:24.330
when schools say to them
they shouldn't say things

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:26.230
that are gonna make somebody feel bad.

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:32.250
The purpose of speech is to express honest

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:33.753
views that people have.

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:38.097
So, I believe hate speech is
as important as love speech,

00:05:38.097 --> 00:05:41.670
and in my view, it's more important.

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:43.230
- So it should be brought to the surface,

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:45.570
rather than operate in the shadows?

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:47.220
- Absolutely.

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:48.420
Absolutely.

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:50.640
- What is the connection
between freedom of speech

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:52.320
and freedom of thought?

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:54.753
- Well, in a free society,

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:58.440
thoughts start in the brain

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:00.453
and then they come out the mouth.

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:04.440
So, they are different
ends of the same spectrum.

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:07.470
- So, to you, the censorship of speech

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:09.900
eventually leads to a
censorship of thought?

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:10.800
- Of course.

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:12.210
Censorship of the mode

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:15.150
by which other people
know what you're thinking.

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:17.313
- So there's some aspect of our society,

00:06:18.554 --> 00:06:20.100
that thinking is done collectively,

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:21.990
and without being able
to speak to each other,

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:23.820
we cannot do this kind
of collective thinking.

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:26.850
- Correct, and the theory
is that, ultimately,

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:28.950
out of speech comes truth.

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:32.130
That isn't necessarily so,

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:34.350
but I do think that when
there's free speech,

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:36.390
better decisions are made,

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:40.530
because people put their
views on the table in a frank,

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:42.300
accurate way,

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:46.320
and then those views mix together,

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:50.430
and clash, and out of that, usually,

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:53.493
comes the better decision.

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:58.800
Not always, but usually,
or more often than not.

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:00.460
But if somebody is not allowed to

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:05.160
sit at the table of decision making,

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:10.160
then the decision making
process is poorer, less robust,

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:15.630
less diverse, and
ultimately less successful.

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:18.390
- So can you elaborate on the idea

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:20.430
of free speech absolutism?

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:22.110
So...

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:23.320
Hate speech

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:27.480
can be quite painful to quite
a large number of people.

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:29.850
Does this worry you?
- Yeah.

00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:34.470
Living in a free society
requires that you expose yourself

00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:36.420
to some discomfort.

00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:38.220
You could call it pain.

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:41.793
It's maybe emotional pain.
It's not physical pain.

00:07:43.890 --> 00:07:48.890
But it's the price we pay
for living in a free society.

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:53.673
Every so often, we're insulted,
we're emotionally hurt.

00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:56.250
Think of the alternative.

00:07:56.250 --> 00:07:58.500
All the alternatives are worse.

00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:01.770
Nobody ever promised us a rose garden.

00:08:01.770 --> 00:08:05.070
We're lucky to be in a country
that has the First Amendment.

00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:09.810
It's also the most diverse
country in the world,

00:08:09.810 --> 00:08:11.163
because of immigration.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.260
I mean, my grandparents
on my father's side

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:17.760
came over from Russia,

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:20.700
on my mother's side,
came over from Poland.

00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:24.210
I'm very happy that my
grandparents came in from Russia.

00:08:24.210 --> 00:08:26.370
I would not want to be in Russia today.

00:08:26.370 --> 00:08:28.830
I'd probably be sharing a cell

00:08:28.830 --> 00:08:30.630
with a Wall Street Journal reporter.

00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:37.260
So, I'm thankful that they came in,

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.240
and this is a great country.

00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:42.180
It's got troubles right now,
but what country doesn't?

00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:45.240
And we've had, before we had a civil war,

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:47.490
we had segregation.

00:08:47.490 --> 00:08:50.640
We had the decimation of the Indians.

00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:52.590
We're not perfect.

00:08:52.590 --> 00:08:54.630
But it's the best place in the world

00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:57.270
for somebody who values liberty.

00:08:57.270 --> 00:08:59.700
- So you don't think that hate speech

00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:02.980
can empower large groups that

00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:07.170
eventually will lead to physical action,

00:09:07.170 --> 00:09:08.460
to physical harm to others?

00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:09.293
- No, I don't.

00:09:09.293 --> 00:09:14.170
I think that we have
developed a culture in which

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:17.430
it's understood that if you
don't like what you hear,

00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:18.843
you talk back.

00:09:20.165 --> 00:09:22.263
You write something.

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:27.513
We don't punch each other.
We insult each other.

00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:31.050
Is insulting great? Well, I don't know.

00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:32.760
It's okay.

00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:35.850
I used to, as a kid in
Brooklyn where I was born,

00:09:35.850 --> 00:09:38.550
I was born and raised in Bensonhurst,

00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:41.190
we used to say, "Sticks and
stones can break my bones,

00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:43.140
but names can never harm me."

00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:44.640
And it's absolutely true.

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:47.400
It what was true when I was
five and it's true when I'm,

00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:49.350
I'm almost 81.

00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:52.500
So, I've lived a long
time, I've seen it all,

00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:56.460
and talking from experience,
as well as theory.

00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:58.560
It's what happens when you reach your 80s.

00:09:59.876 --> 00:10:00.709
(Lex chuckles)

00:10:00.709 --> 00:10:02.317
- I read that you had this line that

00:10:02.317 --> 00:10:04.980
"You cannot be protected from
being called an asshole."

00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:06.240
- Correct.
- (chuckles) Okay.

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:08.152
- [Harvey] Especially
if you're an asshole.

00:10:08.152 --> 00:10:09.800
- (laughs) Well, that's...

00:10:11.344 --> 00:10:12.557
But you don't have to be an
asshole to be called an asshole.

00:10:12.557 --> 00:10:13.470
- [Harvey] That's correct.

00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:16.380
- And I think the internet
has taught me that.

00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:20.220
- Well, the internet has
posed a particular challenge

00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:22.830
to free speech absolutists
because some of the stuff

00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:24.783
that's on there is god awful.

00:10:25.950 --> 00:10:28.740
But I have no different
rule for freedom of speech

00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:33.150
on the internet than I have
in newspapers or in lectures

00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:37.680
or in classrooms, or
conversations among people.

00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:40.770
- What do you think
about the tension between

00:10:40.770 --> 00:10:42.810
freedom of speech and freedom of reach?

00:10:42.810 --> 00:10:45.510
As it's kind of sometimes termed.

00:10:45.510 --> 00:10:48.090
So the internet really
challenges that aspect.

00:10:48.090 --> 00:10:52.350
It allows speech to become
viral and spread very quickly

00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:53.581
to a very large number of people.

00:10:53.581 --> 00:10:56.620
- Yeah, well, you know,
we've had revolutions

00:10:58.110 --> 00:11:02.310
in the modalities of communication.

00:11:02.310 --> 00:11:05.613
After all, newspapers
were the first challenge.

00:11:08.490 --> 00:11:12.873
Radio and television
posed a new challenge.

00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:16.413
The FCC tried,

00:11:17.250 --> 00:11:21.520
but ultimately gave up
the attempt to control

00:11:22.890 --> 00:11:24.603
obscenity, for example.

00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:29.520
And the Supreme Court
has been pretty close.

00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:31.320
The one thing that liberal

00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:33.450
and conservative supreme courts...

00:11:33.450 --> 00:11:34.980
Right now we're in a conservative era,

00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:37.803
due to Trump nominations.

00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:43.650
During much of my life,
it was the Warren Court.

00:11:43.650 --> 00:11:47.730
It was William O. Douglas, Brennan.

00:11:47.730 --> 00:11:49.830
It was a liberal court.

00:11:49.830 --> 00:11:52.380
One thing they agree on is free speech.

00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:54.450
They don't agree on much else,

00:11:54.450 --> 00:11:58.500
but they do agree on free
speech and I think the reason is

00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:01.050
that they recognize that,

00:12:01.050 --> 00:12:04.350
well, my group is in the ascendance today,

00:12:04.350 --> 00:12:08.370
but it may not be tomorrow
and I want to have objective,

00:12:08.370 --> 00:12:11.160
clear rules, so that
when I'm in the minority,

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:13.740
I'm able to voice my opinion.

00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:17.490
And so it's one of the few things that

00:12:17.490 --> 00:12:20.520
both sides of the political
spectrum agree on.

00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:23.250
The only people who don't are the people

00:12:23.250 --> 00:12:25.800
way over on the right
that I call the fascists,

00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:29.553
and the people way over on the
left who are the communists.

00:12:30.450 --> 00:12:35.100
But with respect to most people
on the political spectrum,

00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:38.583
Republicans, Democrats,
socialists, libertarians,

00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:44.100
they agree on the primacy of free speech,

00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:48.600
because it protects them,
when protection is needed.

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:50.613
- So, to you, even on the internet,

00:12:51.690 --> 00:12:54.180
free speech absolutism should rule.

00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:55.530
- Yes.

00:12:55.530 --> 00:12:57.150
Nobody's gonna die.

00:12:57.150 --> 00:13:00.723
Remember, death threats are not protected.

00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:03.960
Nobody's gonna die.

00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:06.060
So, people are gonna be
a little bit insulted?

00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:09.240
That's the price you pay for
living in a free society.

00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:12.153
And it's a small price, in my view.

00:13:13.530 --> 00:13:16.020
Some people don't have as
tough a hide as others?

00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:17.733
Well, then develop it.

00:13:18.780 --> 00:13:22.083
I don't mean to sound cruel,

00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:25.260
but you're living in a free society.

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:26.793
Develop a tough hide.

00:13:27.810 --> 00:13:30.690
- So that's the cost of
living in a free society?

00:13:30.690 --> 00:13:32.640
- [Harvey] Yep. There's a cost.

00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:35.580
- The thing is that it
can really hurt, at scale,

00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:38.190
to be cyber bullied, to be attacked,

00:13:38.190 --> 00:13:41.250
for the ideas you express or
maybe ideas you didn't express,

00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:45.180
but that somebody
decided to lie about you,

00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:48.270
and use that to attack you.

00:13:48.270 --> 00:13:52.890
- Well, first of all,
there are some exceptions

00:13:52.890 --> 00:13:54.570
to the First Amendment.

00:13:54.570 --> 00:13:56.943
Libel and slander is an exception.

00:13:59.610 --> 00:14:02.253
Direct threats are an exception.

00:14:04.043 --> 00:14:06.210
If you say such and such,
"I will murder you."

00:14:06.210 --> 00:14:08.220
That is not lawful.

00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:10.710
If you say to somebody...

00:14:10.710 --> 00:14:13.830
If you say about somebody, "Oh, you know.

00:14:13.830 --> 00:14:15.900
You beat your wife."

00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:17.970
That is not lawful, if in fact,

00:14:17.970 --> 00:14:20.520
the person knows you don't beat your wife.

00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:23.580
There are some limits. Defamation is one.

00:14:23.580 --> 00:14:25.953
Direct threats are another.

00:14:27.630 --> 00:14:32.220
So, the First Amendment is not absolute,

00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:35.760
but it's more absolute than
it is in any other society,

00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:37.983
and it's pretty near absolute.

00:14:40.530 --> 00:14:42.390
For example, fraud.

00:14:42.390 --> 00:14:45.607
If you sell somebody a car, and you say,

00:14:45.607 --> 00:14:47.280
"Oh, this is in great running shape,

00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:48.990
and in fact it's an old jalopy,

00:14:48.990 --> 00:14:52.890
and it's not gonna make it more
than 10 miles, that's fraud.

00:14:52.890 --> 00:14:54.243
That's not free speech.

00:14:55.350 --> 00:14:59.190
So, free speech is not absolute,
there are these limits,

00:14:59.190 --> 00:15:03.240
but they're very narrow,
specific categories of limits.

00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:05.640
- But there's gray area here, because,

00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:09.360
while legally you're not
allowed to defame a person,

00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:11.130
in the court of public opinion,

00:15:11.130 --> 00:15:14.790
especially with the aid of
anonymity on the internet,

00:15:14.790 --> 00:15:18.120
rumors can spread, at scale.

00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:19.980
Thousands, hundreds of
thousands of people,

00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:22.650
can make up things about you.

00:15:22.650 --> 00:15:24.780
- You have to defend yourself.

00:15:24.780 --> 00:15:26.910
- [Lex] Using more speech.

00:15:26.910 --> 00:15:29.733
- Through freedom of speech,
we're big boys and girls.

00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:32.120
You have to defend yourself.

00:15:34.050 --> 00:15:36.830
In some societies, if you say something...

00:15:38.430 --> 00:15:40.770
Right now, if you say
something nasty about Putin,

00:15:40.770 --> 00:15:42.423
you'll end up in the gulag.

00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:46.740
If you say something nasty about Biden,

00:15:46.740 --> 00:15:48.210
you end up in "The New York Times".

00:15:48.210 --> 00:15:49.560
Where would you rather be?

00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:52.770
- Well, let's talk about
the thing you've done

00:15:52.770 --> 00:15:56.490
for over 20 years, which is
fight for the freedom of speech

00:15:56.490 --> 00:15:58.500
on college campuses.

00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:01.440
So, why is freedom of speech
important on college campuses?

00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:03.870
- Well, it's important
everywhere in the society,

00:16:03.870 --> 00:16:06.390
but it's most important
on college campuses.

00:16:06.390 --> 00:16:07.590
Why?

00:16:07.590 --> 00:16:11.343
'Cause that's where we
educate our young citizens.

00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:17.240
And if you are educated
under a notion that some dean

00:16:19.251 --> 00:16:21.780
can call you on the carpet,

00:16:21.780 --> 00:16:24.720
because you say something
which is considered racist,

00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:28.833
or you can say something
which is considered dangerous

00:16:31.170 --> 00:16:33.153
to social cohesion,

00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:37.263
then it's not a liberal arts college.

00:16:39.330 --> 00:16:44.330
The theory that I used in
"The Shadow University"-

00:16:44.550 --> 00:16:46.830
- A book you've written.
"The Shadow University".

00:16:46.830 --> 00:16:48.191
- [Harvey] 1998.

00:16:48.191 --> 00:16:49.024
- 1998.

00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:51.810
You were ahead of a lot of
these things, by the way.

00:16:51.810 --> 00:16:54.720
- I'm afraid that as a pessimist,

00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:57.187
I always saw the bad side of things.

00:16:57.187 --> 00:16:59.610
- "Betrayal of Liberty
on America's Campuses:

00:16:59.610 --> 00:17:01.170
The Shadow University".

00:17:01.170 --> 00:17:03.240
A book you co-authored with Alan Charles.

00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:06.090
- Yes, with one of my Princeton
classmates, Alan Charles,

00:17:06.090 --> 00:17:08.670
of course, who's now an emeritus professor

00:17:08.670 --> 00:17:11.793
of enlightenment history at
the University of Pennsylvania.

00:17:12.630 --> 00:17:16.320
I only taught for one semester
and I can go into that later.

00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:20.073
The reason that I did not
continue to teach in colleges.

00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:22.740
It was Harvard Law School.

00:17:22.740 --> 00:17:25.233
I taught a course in the mid-1980s.

00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:28.350
But in any event,

00:17:28.350 --> 00:17:31.180
the college campuses are
one of the most important

00:17:32.820 --> 00:17:36.900
for free speech because it's
where people get education.

00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:39.420
And if you don't really
get a good education,

00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:42.600
if certain points of view are
not allowed to be expressed,

00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:46.800
because education comes
from the clash of ideas,

00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:48.551
and you then have to decide...

00:17:48.551 --> 00:17:52.440
This is how you become a thinking adult.

00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:56.130
You have to decide which
ideas make more sense to you,

00:17:56.130 --> 00:17:57.813
which ones you're gonna follow.

00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:01.383
The college experience is transformative.

00:18:02.730 --> 00:18:05.820
And if there is censorship on campuses,

00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:10.820
it's highly destructive of
the educational enterprise

00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:14.880
and ultimately to the entire society.

00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:16.833
We have, in the sciences,

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:21.390
we have scientific method.

00:18:21.390 --> 00:18:24.840
Scientific method is you try experiments

00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:28.260
and you see which ones work
and then you develop theories,

00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:30.810
based upon the results of experiments.

00:18:30.810 --> 00:18:32.070
Well, this is not much different

00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:34.380
from every other aspect of life.

00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:38.010
You have to entertain different
views on different subjects.

00:18:38.010 --> 00:18:40.230
You hear all the views
and you make a decision

00:18:40.230 --> 00:18:42.960
as to which one's accurate
and which one's not.

00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:47.760
So, the scientific method
I apply to non-science,

00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:50.433
to history, to journalism.

00:18:51.930 --> 00:18:53.490
To all of these things.

00:18:53.490 --> 00:18:56.460
- So that scientific
method includes ideas.

00:18:56.460 --> 00:18:57.960
Hateful ideas, also.
- Correct.

00:18:57.960 --> 00:19:00.270
If you don't allow hateful ideas...

00:19:00.270 --> 00:19:04.657
I mean, when scientists do
experiments, nobody says to them,

00:19:04.657 --> 00:19:07.440
"Oh, you know, don't do that experiment,

00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:08.850
because it would be very bad,

00:19:08.850 --> 00:19:12.360
if that turns out to be
accurate, that outcome."

00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:13.760
That's not the way it works.

00:19:15.450 --> 00:19:20.190
Every point of view is
thrown into the marketplace,

00:19:20.190 --> 00:19:25.140
whether it's science or
whether it's non-science.

00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:27.987
- And that includes the kind of ideas

00:19:27.987 --> 00:19:30.450
and the kind of discourse
that might actually

00:19:30.450 --> 00:19:33.270
lead to an increase in hate on campuses?

00:19:33.270 --> 00:19:35.140
- The First Amendment

00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:40.533
prohibits speech which is
liable to produce imminent,

00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:43.200
imminent violence.

00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:45.213
- Yeah.
- So, for example.

00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:51.600
The exception is yelling, falsely,

00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:54.720
falsely yelling "fire" in
a crowded movie theater.

00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:56.400
A lot of people misstate it.

00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:58.590
They say, "Oh, the exception

00:19:58.590 --> 00:20:00.000
is yelling 'fire' in a movie theater."

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:01.170
Well, if there's really a fire,

00:20:01.170 --> 00:20:03.870
you're performing a
real important function.

00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:05.520
- [Lex] They usually
don't mention that part.

00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:07.770
- But it's falsely yelling "fire".

00:20:07.770 --> 00:20:08.850
You could start a riot.

00:20:08.850 --> 00:20:11.700
People would be crushed trying to get out.

00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:16.200
So, that's one of the exceptions
to the First Amendment,

00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:18.033
as the Supreme Court has defined it.

00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:21.903
There are very few exceptions.

00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:25.050
And defamation is an exception.

00:20:25.050 --> 00:20:28.920
I'm not a fan of that exception, frankly,

00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:32.910
but if you say something about somebody

00:20:32.910 --> 00:20:37.380
that has serious
implications in their life,

00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:39.540
in their ability to earn a living,

00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:42.420
if you accuse somebody
of being a pedophile,

00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:45.783
when it's not true,
that person can sue you.

00:20:47.220 --> 00:20:50.100
My own view is, I think that's
an unfortunate exception,

00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:52.353
but I'm not on the Supreme Court.

00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:56.870
I think that I'm with...

00:20:58.451 --> 00:21:00.780
A friend of mine was Nat Hentoff.

00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:02.970
Nat Hentoff who wrote for decades

00:21:02.970 --> 00:21:04.953
for "The Village Voice" in New York.

00:21:06.810 --> 00:21:08.520
He was a friend of mine.

00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:11.160
He was a free speech absolutist.

00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:13.717
And he wrote a fabulous book called,

00:21:13.717 --> 00:21:16.287
"Free Speech For Me, But Not For Thee".

00:21:18.060 --> 00:21:21.930
And he was an absolutist
and I'm with Nat Hentoff.

00:21:21.930 --> 00:21:23.370
- Even on the defamation aspect.

00:21:23.370 --> 00:21:27.270
I agree with you in some sense,
just practically speaking,

00:21:27.270 --> 00:21:28.390
it seems like

00:21:30.467 --> 00:21:34.170
that the best way in the
public sphere to defend

00:21:34.170 --> 00:21:37.260
against defamation is with more speech.

00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:38.130
- [Harvey] Correct.

00:21:38.130 --> 00:21:42.250
- And through authenticity,
through authentic communication

00:21:43.650 --> 00:21:45.360
of the truth, as you see it.

00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:48.120
- Yeah, you know, at
times, "The Boston Globe"

00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:50.850
has said something about me
that hasn't been accurate.

00:21:50.850 --> 00:21:54.660
They have invariably published
my letter to the editor.

00:21:54.660 --> 00:21:56.580
I'm also

00:21:56.580 --> 00:21:59.940
not bashful about getting
in touch with the reporter.

00:21:59.940 --> 00:22:01.140
At the end of every column,

00:22:01.140 --> 00:22:03.453
they give the reporter's email address.

00:22:05.490 --> 00:22:09.180
And I know people say
that I have more access

00:22:09.180 --> 00:22:10.983
to the media than most people,

00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:15.933
but all that means is I get
defamed more than most people.

00:22:16.860 --> 00:22:18.270
- Can we also comment on,

00:22:18.270 --> 00:22:21.183
from the individual consumer of speech,

00:22:22.170 --> 00:22:27.170
there's a kind of sense
that freedom of speech means

00:22:27.210 --> 00:22:30.150
you should be forced to read all of it.

00:22:30.150 --> 00:22:32.910
Freedom of speech,
versus freedom of reach.

00:22:32.910 --> 00:22:35.100
We, as consumers of speech,

00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:37.380
do we have the right
to select what we read?

00:22:37.380 --> 00:22:41.760
- We do, and nobody can
force us to sit in a room

00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:45.090
and listen to a radio program
that we don't wanna listen to.

00:22:45.090 --> 00:22:48.090
Nobody can force us to read a
book that we don't wanna read.

00:22:49.830 --> 00:22:53.130
The whole motion of freedom
of speech means that

00:22:53.130 --> 00:22:57.060
people have autonomy on their choices.

00:22:57.060 --> 00:23:00.480
- In order to form a complete
mind and complete human being,

00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:04.560
there's a kind of
tension of that autonomy,

00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:08.340
versus consuming as many varied
perspectives as possible,

00:23:08.340 --> 00:23:11.580
which is underlying the
ethic of free speech.

00:23:11.580 --> 00:23:13.533
So, on college campuses,

00:23:14.370 --> 00:23:17.520
it seems like a good
way to develop the mind

00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:19.290
is to get as many
perspectives as possible.

00:23:19.290 --> 00:23:22.170
Even if you don't really want to.

00:23:22.170 --> 00:23:25.350
- Well, that is the theory.

00:23:25.350 --> 00:23:26.590
Academic freedom

00:23:28.477 --> 00:23:32.790
is supposed to be the highest
degree of free speech.

00:23:32.790 --> 00:23:33.780
- [Lex] Yeah.

00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:36.030
- You should be able to entertain

00:23:36.030 --> 00:23:40.440
all kinds of hateful, threatening ideas.

00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:42.600
And the way I put it is,

00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:46.620
there's something wrong
when you can say something

00:23:46.620 --> 00:23:51.210
with complete abandon, without
any fear, in Harvard Square.

00:23:51.210 --> 00:23:52.800
Whereas on the other side of the fence,

00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:54.570
you can't say it in Harvard Yard.

00:23:54.570 --> 00:23:55.983
It should be the opposite.

00:23:56.850 --> 00:23:59.160
And what happens is,

00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:02.820
universities, from the best to the worst,

00:24:02.820 --> 00:24:05.730
from the most famous to
the least well known,

00:24:05.730 --> 00:24:08.493
have been taken over by administrators.

00:24:09.450 --> 00:24:13.560
Administrators do not really
subsume academic values.

00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:15.450
They know nothing about the constitution.

00:24:15.450 --> 00:24:16.860
They know nothing about free speech.

00:24:16.860 --> 00:24:19.230
They know nothing about academic freedom.

00:24:19.230 --> 00:24:21.543
They feel that their job is to keep order.

00:24:22.890 --> 00:24:26.550
And so they develop speech codes,

00:24:26.550 --> 00:24:29.373
kangaroo courts to
enforce the speech codes.

00:24:30.570 --> 00:24:32.670
And these are very dire developments.

00:24:32.670 --> 00:24:35.643
I wrote about them in "The
Shadow University" in '98,

00:24:37.290 --> 00:24:40.233
and tried to deal with them in 1999,

00:24:40.233 --> 00:24:43.173
when I started FIRE, co-started FIRE.

00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:48.960
I would fire...

00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:50.610
The reason I'm running currently

00:24:50.610 --> 00:24:52.920
for the Harvard Board of Overseers is

00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:56.040
what I'd like to do is convince
the Harvard Corporation,

00:24:56.040 --> 00:24:59.220
the so-called President
Fellows of Harvard College,

00:24:59.220 --> 00:25:01.860
the chief governing
board of the university

00:25:01.860 --> 00:25:03.033
with the real power.

00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:06.930
The Board of Overseers
is a secondary body,

00:25:06.930 --> 00:25:08.493
but quite influential.

00:25:10.260 --> 00:25:13.680
To fire 95% of the administrators.

00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:15.900
It would have a salutary effect

00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:17.820
on the academics of the university.

00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:20.460
It would have a salutary
effect on free speech

00:25:20.460 --> 00:25:21.960
and academic freedom.

00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:25.013
It would cut tuitions by about 40%.

00:25:26.130 --> 00:25:28.950
And it would create a
whole different atmosphere

00:25:28.950 --> 00:25:31.890
on the campus and the
same could be said of MIT,

00:25:31.890 --> 00:25:33.093
or any other place.

00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:36.370
I think administrators are

00:25:38.012 --> 00:25:39.010
a very

00:25:40.740 --> 00:25:44.250
bad influence on American
higher education.

00:25:44.250 --> 00:25:48.810
- Can you elaborate the
intuition of why this thing

00:25:48.810 --> 00:25:51.450
that you call "administrative bloat"

00:25:51.450 --> 00:25:53.220
is such a bad thing for a university?

00:25:53.220 --> 00:25:54.423
- Well, first of all.

00:25:54.423 --> 00:25:58.800
Just in terms of the cost of maintaining.

00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:01.740
There are more administrators
in American higher education

00:26:01.740 --> 00:26:04.230
than there are faculty members.

00:26:04.230 --> 00:26:06.300
The cost is enormous.

00:26:06.300 --> 00:26:08.040
Number two.

00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:10.330
They are inimical to

00:26:12.291 --> 00:26:14.040
the teaching enterprise

00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:17.730
and they feel that their
job is to control things,

00:26:17.730 --> 00:26:19.800
to make sure there are no problems,

00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:21.483
and nobody's feelings are hurt.

00:26:23.730 --> 00:26:28.660
Being called before a dean
because you said something

00:26:29.910 --> 00:26:33.000
that insulted somebody is
something that shouldn't happen

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:34.950
in American higher
education, yet it happens,

00:26:34.950 --> 00:26:36.780
because you have these
administrators who think

00:26:36.780 --> 00:26:40.800
it's their job to protect
people from being insulted.

00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:44.643
You insult a black student,
you insult a woman,

00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:46.950
there's a disciplinary hearing.

00:26:46.950 --> 00:26:48.200
Well, there shouldn't be.

00:26:50.430 --> 00:26:54.810
Black people are accustomed
to being insulted.

00:26:54.810 --> 00:26:57.630
Jews are accustomed to being insulted.

00:26:57.630 --> 00:26:59.910
Women are accustomed to being insulted.

00:26:59.910 --> 00:27:03.960
And it's very good to
know who doesn't like you.

00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:04.953
It's useful.

00:27:06.030 --> 00:27:09.960
It's essential information
to know who doesn't like you.

00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:12.090
If everybody is forced to say "I love you"

00:27:12.090 --> 00:27:13.770
and nobody can say "I hate you",

00:27:13.770 --> 00:27:16.710
you get a false view of
what life is all about.

00:27:16.710 --> 00:27:17.940
- [Lex] Outside of the university.

00:27:17.940 --> 00:27:19.050
- Outside of the university.

00:27:19.050 --> 00:27:21.603
I mean, you do graduate, eventually.

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:26.090
- And that's ultimately the
mission of the university

00:27:26.090 --> 00:27:29.100
is to prepare you, to make
you into a great human being,

00:27:29.100 --> 00:27:29.970
into a great leader,

00:27:29.970 --> 00:27:31.560
that can take on the
problems of the world.

00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:32.393
- Correct.

00:27:32.393 --> 00:27:36.540
And you don't do it by treating
you like a little flower.

00:27:36.540 --> 00:27:38.280
- But what role does the university have

00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:40.110
to protect students?

00:27:40.110 --> 00:27:43.200
To women, African Americans.

00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:44.460
Anybody. Jews.

00:27:44.460 --> 00:27:47.460
Anybody who could be a
victim of hate speech.

00:27:47.460 --> 00:27:50.730
- They protect you from physical assault.

00:27:50.730 --> 00:27:55.730
If somebody physically assaults
you, then they get punished.

00:27:56.310 --> 00:28:00.600
But they shouldn't protect
you against insult,

00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:03.270
because that is a violation
of academic freedom.

00:28:03.270 --> 00:28:06.030
The freedom of the
insulter, to insult you.

00:28:06.030 --> 00:28:07.950
And also, as I said,

00:28:07.950 --> 00:28:10.650
it's very useful to know
who doesn't like you.

00:28:10.650 --> 00:28:13.410
It's useful for the so-called victim.

00:28:13.410 --> 00:28:17.520
I think, as I said, I wanna
know who doesn't like me.

00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:20.970
It's as important to me as
knowing who who likes me.

00:28:20.970 --> 00:28:25.410
- But do you also believe in
this open space of discourse

00:28:25.410 --> 00:28:28.170
that the insulter will eventually lose?

00:28:28.170 --> 00:28:29.280
- I think that's true.

00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:32.040
I think that the insulter, eventually,

00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:33.843
will wear out his or her welcome.

00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:39.437
I do, but I like to know
who the insulters are.

00:28:39.437 --> 00:28:41.310
- [Lex] 'Cause it gives
you a deeper understanding

00:28:41.310 --> 00:28:42.210
of human nature.

00:28:42.210 --> 00:28:44.640
- Yeah, and usually, by the way,

00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:47.310
my experience has been that
the insulters have generally

00:28:47.310 --> 00:28:50.520
not been as smart as the
people they've insulted.

00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:53.250
And that's probably one of
the reasons they insult them,

00:28:53.250 --> 00:28:56.040
because they feel inferior.

00:28:56.040 --> 00:28:59.670
I mean, I'm not trying to
be a psychoanalyst here,

00:28:59.670 --> 00:29:03.240
but a lot of the people
who are the haters are

00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:06.630
pretty low down on the intellectual scale.

00:29:06.630 --> 00:29:07.463
- Anyway.

00:29:07.463 --> 00:29:11.880
95% of administration, you would fire.

00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:15.810
You're calling to fire
95% of the administration.

00:29:15.810 --> 00:29:17.670
- Correct.
- People should know.

00:29:17.670 --> 00:29:22.410
I think people that don't really
think about the structure,

00:29:22.410 --> 00:29:26.850
the way the universities work,
are not familiar, I think,

00:29:26.850 --> 00:29:28.650
with the fact that administration,

00:29:28.650 --> 00:29:31.470
there's a huge bloat of administration.

00:29:31.470 --> 00:29:33.183
When you think about what
makes a great university,

00:29:33.183 --> 00:29:35.430
it's about the students,
it's about the faculty,

00:29:35.430 --> 00:29:37.020
it's about the people that do research,

00:29:37.020 --> 00:29:38.553
if it's a research university.

00:29:39.510 --> 00:29:42.330
They don't think about the
bureaucracy of meetings

00:29:42.330 --> 00:29:46.170
and committees and rules
and paperwork and all that,

00:29:46.170 --> 00:29:47.790
and all the people that are involved

00:29:47.790 --> 00:29:49.290
with pushing that kind of paper,

00:29:49.290 --> 00:29:51.090
and there's a huge cost to that,

00:29:51.090 --> 00:29:55.140
but it also slows down and suppresses

00:29:55.140 --> 00:29:58.770
the beautiful variety that
makes a university great,

00:29:58.770 --> 00:30:02.763
which is the teaching, the
student life, the protests,

00:30:05.112 --> 00:30:07.770
the clubs, all the fun that
you can have in a university.

00:30:07.770 --> 00:30:09.600
All the varied exploration,

00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:11.520
which you can't really
do once you graduate.

00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:12.570
- Correct.
- It's the place.

00:30:12.570 --> 00:30:14.790
The university is a
place to really explore.

00:30:14.790 --> 00:30:16.683
- Mm-hm.
- In every single way.

00:30:17.820 --> 00:30:20.490
So, let me just talk about
this important thing,

00:30:20.490 --> 00:30:24.270
because I'm very fortunate
to have contacted you,

00:30:24.270 --> 00:30:27.630
almost by accident, in a very
important moment in your life.

00:30:27.630 --> 00:30:32.630
You're running for the
Harvard Board of Overseers.

00:30:32.820 --> 00:30:36.570
What is this board? How
much power does it have?

00:30:36.570 --> 00:30:38.400
And what would you do, if elected?

00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:41.790
- Okay, first of all, I have a prediction

00:30:41.790 --> 00:30:43.140
that in about five years,

00:30:43.140 --> 00:30:44.460
they're gonna probably change the name,

00:30:44.460 --> 00:30:48.600
because "Overseers" reminds
people of the slavery era

00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:52.140
and we're in such a
politically-correct era now

00:30:52.140 --> 00:30:54.907
that the English language
is being restricted.

00:30:54.907 --> 00:30:57.210
"Corrupted" is the way I put it.

00:30:57.210 --> 00:31:01.200
Because certain words are forbidden.

00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:03.390
We have some problems in this country,

00:31:03.390 --> 00:31:07.350
and I think a part of the
problem is the educational system

00:31:07.350 --> 00:31:09.750
has lost the sense of
what academic freedom

00:31:09.750 --> 00:31:11.343
and free speech are all about.

00:31:13.350 --> 00:31:18.350
And I think it's essential that
the educational system begin

00:31:18.780 --> 00:31:21.177
to take more seriously what free speech

00:31:21.177 --> 00:31:24.240
and academic freedom really are!

00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:27.150
That's why I'm running for the
Harvard Board of Overseers.

00:31:27.150 --> 00:31:28.630
- So, let me just linger on

00:31:30.787 --> 00:31:34.560
the role of the administration
in protecting free speech.

00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:37.020
So what often happens and I
think you've written about this,

00:31:37.020 --> 00:31:40.140
is there's going to be
maybe a small number

00:31:40.140 --> 00:31:43.110
of hypersensitive students
and faculty that protest.

00:31:43.110 --> 00:31:45.400
So, how does Harvard administration

00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:50.940
resist the influence of those
hypersensitive protestors

00:31:50.940 --> 00:31:55.620
in protecting speech, in
protecting even hate speech?

00:31:55.620 --> 00:31:58.380
- Harvard has done fairly well,

00:31:58.380 --> 00:32:01.533
under the presidency of Lawrence Bacow.

00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:05.793
I have had a couple of
meetings with Bacow.

00:32:07.290 --> 00:32:08.393
I like Bacow.

00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:13.230
I have donated to Harvard a print of,

00:32:13.230 --> 00:32:17.370
my late wife took a picture of
Bob Dylan and Allen Ginsburg

00:32:17.370 --> 00:32:21.600
when "The Rolling Thunder
Review" got to Harvard Square,

00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:24.900
and it's sort of an iconic photograph.

00:32:24.900 --> 00:32:27.930
She called it "The Music
Lesson", 'cause it's got Dylan

00:32:27.930 --> 00:32:30.600
teaching Ginsburg how to play the guitar.

00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:33.930
And I donated one of those to Harvard.

00:32:33.930 --> 00:32:36.003
It's hanging in Bacow's office.

00:32:37.560 --> 00:32:40.680
The new president, Claudine Gay,

00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:43.287
is not known for
respecting academic freedom

00:32:43.287 --> 00:32:45.210
and free speech.

00:32:45.210 --> 00:32:46.950
People have said to me,
"Well, give her a chance."

00:32:46.950 --> 00:32:49.140
Well, I'm willing to give her a chance,

00:32:49.140 --> 00:32:53.043
but she does have a record,
and she's a bureaucrat.

00:32:53.910 --> 00:32:55.770
I don't think she believes in free speech

00:32:55.770 --> 00:32:57.300
and academic freedom.

00:32:57.300 --> 00:33:00.510
I think she's a
progressive, not a liberal.

00:33:00.510 --> 00:33:02.290
I'm not happy with

00:33:04.470 --> 00:33:07.650
the appointment of Claudine Gay,

00:33:07.650 --> 00:33:10.230
and it has made more essential

00:33:10.230 --> 00:33:13.320
my attempt to get on
the Board of Overseers.

00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:15.810
- So, let's talk about
the Board of Overseers,

00:33:15.810 --> 00:33:18.330
and your run for it.

00:33:18.330 --> 00:33:20.010
The specifics, actually.
- Okay.

00:33:20.010 --> 00:33:24.820
- It'll be nice because I think
you're a write-in candidate

00:33:25.740 --> 00:33:28.653
and the election is over on May 16th?

00:33:29.700 --> 00:33:30.660
- [Harvey] Yes.

00:33:30.660 --> 00:33:32.310
- And I think there are specifics.

00:33:32.310 --> 00:33:34.200
I'll probably give them in the intro.

00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:37.530
I'll give links to people but
the specifics are complicated.

00:33:37.530 --> 00:33:42.530
Let me just mention that you
have to be Harvard alumni.

00:33:42.750 --> 00:33:45.090
So have graduated from Harvard.

00:33:45.090 --> 00:33:47.310
- [Harvey] You have to in order
to run and in order to vote.

00:33:47.310 --> 00:33:48.270
- In order to vote.

00:33:48.270 --> 00:33:51.603
And the process, I imagine
is not trivial, but,

00:33:53.490 --> 00:33:56.670
this is done online and
if you're an alumni,

00:33:56.670 --> 00:33:58.530
you should have received an email from

00:33:58.530 --> 00:33:59.730
a particular email address,

00:33:59.730 --> 00:34:03.570
harvard@mgelectionservicescourt.com.

00:34:03.570 --> 00:34:07.770
And presumably there's a way
to get some validation number

00:34:07.770 --> 00:34:09.990
from that email and then you go online,

00:34:09.990 --> 00:34:12.030
you enter that validation
number and you vote

00:34:12.030 --> 00:34:17.030
and to vote for Harvey,
you have to enter his name,

00:34:17.190 --> 00:34:21.663
correctly, Harvey Silverglate,
and spell it correctly.

00:34:22.500 --> 00:34:26.850
Obviously I'm imagining this,
because I'm MIT, not Harvard,

00:34:26.850 --> 00:34:29.550
so I'm imagining the
process is not trivial,

00:34:29.550 --> 00:34:31.900
'cause you have to click
on things, you have to

00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:37.770
follow instructions that are not trivial.

00:34:37.770 --> 00:34:41.970
And I'll also provide an email
if the process is painful,

00:34:41.970 --> 00:34:42.810
it doesn't work for you,

00:34:42.810 --> 00:34:45.630
that you can email Harvard and complain.

00:34:45.630 --> 00:34:48.330
IThelp@Harvard.edu and so on.

00:34:48.330 --> 00:34:49.680
I'll provide all the links.

00:34:49.680 --> 00:34:51.780
But is there something else you can say

00:34:51.780 --> 00:34:55.500
about the voting process,
what you're running on?

00:34:55.500 --> 00:34:57.183
- This is my second run.

00:34:58.470 --> 00:35:01.590
The first time, I got enough signatures

00:35:01.590 --> 00:35:03.210
to get on the ballot.

00:35:03.210 --> 00:35:08.010
Then the Harvard Alumni Association

00:35:08.010 --> 00:35:11.160
sent out a letter

00:35:11.160 --> 00:35:13.533
to all living Harvard alums,

00:35:14.580 --> 00:35:16.920
recommending that they vote

00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:20.670
for the officially-nominated candidates.

00:35:20.670 --> 00:35:24.783
That excluded two petition
candidates, of whom I was one.

00:35:26.250 --> 00:35:31.250
And I wrote to the Alumni
Association and I said,

00:35:31.597 --> 00:35:35.891
"You have now sent out
the curriculum vitaes,

00:35:35.891 --> 00:35:37.680
and the policy positions

00:35:37.680 --> 00:35:41.040
of all the officially-nominated
candidates.

00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:44.370
There are two petition
candidates on the ballot.

00:35:44.370 --> 00:35:47.530
I would like to be able to send out my

00:35:48.780 --> 00:35:51.813
positions to the voters.

00:35:52.680 --> 00:35:54.577
They wrote me back saying,

00:35:54.577 --> 00:35:59.370
"Our policy is to only send
out the policy positions

00:35:59.370 --> 00:36:02.550
and the platforms of
officially-nominated candidates."

00:36:02.550 --> 00:36:04.560
Can you believe that?

00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:07.743
Well, this is a liberal
arts college, right?

00:36:09.570 --> 00:36:12.450
Where, from the clash
of ideas, truth emerges.

00:36:12.450 --> 00:36:13.503
Well, really?

00:36:14.580 --> 00:36:18.960
This is what I call
Harvard's not-so-subtle means

00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:21.870
of candidate suppression,
not voter suppression.

00:36:21.870 --> 00:36:23.313
Candidate suppression.

00:36:24.390 --> 00:36:28.833
And everybody can vote,
but not everybody can run.

00:36:31.496 --> 00:36:35.130
Ill becomes a liberal arts college

00:36:35.130 --> 00:36:38.070
where the clash of ideas
will produce the truth.

00:36:38.070 --> 00:36:38.903
Well, what about the clash of ideas

00:36:38.903 --> 00:36:41.820
of the Board of Overseers?

00:36:41.820 --> 00:36:43.560
The Board of Overseers is important.

00:36:43.560 --> 00:36:46.560
It doesn't have the
same power or authority

00:36:46.560 --> 00:36:48.090
as the Harvard Corporation,

00:36:48.090 --> 00:36:51.720
the so-called President and
Fellows of Harvard College.

00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:55.740
But it's very influential
and very important

00:36:55.740 --> 00:36:58.410
and it would be a great perch for me to

00:36:58.410 --> 00:37:02.550
try to exert influence for
the university to get back

00:37:02.550 --> 00:37:04.470
to where it was before it was taken over

00:37:04.470 --> 00:37:05.820
by the administrators.

00:37:05.820 --> 00:37:09.270
- Well, I'm pretty sure
that most of Harvard alumni,

00:37:09.270 --> 00:37:11.400
most of the students
currently going to Harvard,

00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:13.470
most of the faculty at Harvard,

00:37:13.470 --> 00:37:15.540
probably stand behind the ideas

00:37:15.540 --> 00:37:17.610
and the ideals that you stand behind.

00:37:17.610 --> 00:37:18.720
- [Harvey] Yep.

00:37:18.720 --> 00:37:21.210
- The people that love Harvard
and what it stands for.

00:37:21.210 --> 00:37:23.583
- The alumni were educated in an era

00:37:23.583 --> 00:37:27.870
when these concepts were
taken more seriously

00:37:27.870 --> 00:37:32.430
and before the administrators took over.

00:37:32.430 --> 00:37:34.440
So, I do think if I get my message out,

00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:36.000
I'm gonna win a seat.

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:39.400
And if I win a seat, I
will have a great perch

00:37:40.934 --> 00:37:44.280
for trying to convince
the real power that be,

00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:46.440
which is the Harvard Corporation,

00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:48.840
to do the things that I'm suggesting.

00:37:48.840 --> 00:37:51.270
Get rid of 95% of the administrators,

00:37:51.270 --> 00:37:55.500
get rid of their speech
codes, reduce tuition by 40%.

00:37:55.500 --> 00:37:58.533
All of these salutary benefits.

00:37:59.640 --> 00:38:01.410
Can you imagine if Harvard became

00:38:01.410 --> 00:38:03.963
the most affordable college
in the United States?

00:38:05.190 --> 00:38:07.500
- Well, the affordability
is another aspect,

00:38:07.500 --> 00:38:12.030
but I think before that, just
the freedom of expression,

00:38:12.030 --> 00:38:13.710
freedom of speech, freedom of thought

00:38:13.710 --> 00:38:16.740
at America's greatest
universities, I think,

00:38:16.740 --> 00:38:19.366
is something that
everybody would agree on.

00:38:19.366 --> 00:38:22.430
- [Harvey] It would
have a tremendous effect

00:38:22.430 --> 00:38:24.033
on the whole country.

00:38:26.310 --> 00:38:29.790
- And is there something
to say about the details

00:38:29.790 --> 00:38:33.240
of how difficult it is for alumni to vote?

00:38:33.240 --> 00:38:35.520
Do you have experience with this?

00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:39.180
- You could vote online or
you can vote by paper ballot.

00:38:39.180 --> 00:38:41.043
You could request a paper ballot.

00:38:42.420 --> 00:38:44.940
And all I could say is that the hard part

00:38:44.940 --> 00:38:46.293
is getting the message out.

00:38:47.370 --> 00:38:49.320
My name doesn't appear on the ballot,

00:38:49.320 --> 00:38:52.080
'cause I couldn't get enough signatures.

00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:55.260
- Well, Harvey, Harvey Silverglate.

00:38:55.260 --> 00:38:58.710
- S-I-L-V-E-R-G-L-A-T-E.

00:38:58.710 --> 00:39:01.983
When my grandparents arrived from Russia,

00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:07.503
the name in Russia was
something like Zilbaglit,

00:39:08.340 --> 00:39:12.030
and the immigration officer
had several choices.

00:39:12.030 --> 00:39:15.240
He could have said
Silvergate. Gate is a real...

00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:18.150
Silver and gate are real English words.

00:39:18.150 --> 00:39:21.990
He could have said Silverglade. G-L-A-D-E.

00:39:21.990 --> 00:39:23.370
Those are real English words.

00:39:23.370 --> 00:39:25.440
That's how my name is often misspelled.

00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:28.170
Either Silvergate or Silverglade.

00:39:28.170 --> 00:39:31.590
Silverglate is a nonsense syllable.

00:39:31.590 --> 00:39:34.860
And why the immigration officer chose

00:39:34.860 --> 00:39:39.480
to transliterate Zilbaglit as Silverglate,

00:39:39.480 --> 00:39:41.250
I'll never understand,

00:39:41.250 --> 00:39:45.840
and it is the cause of
endless mistakes in my name.

00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:48.910
- [Lex] Well, the the
fundamental absurdity of life

00:39:49.848 --> 00:39:51.630
is also the source of its beauty.

00:39:51.630 --> 00:39:52.470
- Yes.

00:39:52.470 --> 00:39:53.303
- Anyway.

00:39:53.303 --> 00:39:55.660
We shall spell it out and we shall

00:39:56.970 --> 00:40:00.150
yell loud and wide

00:40:00.150 --> 00:40:02.760
that everybody who has
ever graduated from Harvard

00:40:02.760 --> 00:40:05.460
should vote for you, if
they believe in the ideals

00:40:05.460 --> 00:40:06.960
of the great American universities,

00:40:06.960 --> 00:40:08.410
which I think most people do.

00:40:10.590 --> 00:40:12.460
Let me also ask about

00:40:13.470 --> 00:40:15.723
diversity, inclusion and equity programs.

00:40:16.591 --> 00:40:20.460
You've had a few harsh
words to say about those.

00:40:20.460 --> 00:40:23.850
The idea of diversity, I
think, is a beautiful ideal.

00:40:23.850 --> 00:40:25.650
You've said that Harvard's
idea of diversity

00:40:25.650 --> 00:40:28.860
is for everyone to look
different and think alike.

00:40:28.860 --> 00:40:30.510
- Correct.
- Can you elaborate?

00:40:30.510 --> 00:40:32.070
- And be comfortable.

00:40:32.070 --> 00:40:33.750
- And be comfortable.
- Yeah.

00:40:33.750 --> 00:40:35.790
First of all, it is impossible,

00:40:35.790 --> 00:40:38.280
if liberal arts education
is taken seriously,

00:40:38.280 --> 00:40:41.640
it's impossible for students
to feel comfortable.

00:40:41.640 --> 00:40:42.810
Why?

00:40:42.810 --> 00:40:46.140
Because one of the roles
of college is to challenge

00:40:46.140 --> 00:40:48.000
all the beliefs that they grew up with,

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:50.880
which mostly are the beliefs inculcated

00:40:50.880 --> 00:40:53.583
by parents and by
elementary school teachers.

00:40:54.570 --> 00:40:58.200
And the idea is to be able to challenge

00:40:58.200 --> 00:41:01.680
those thoughts, those ideas.

00:41:01.680 --> 00:41:04.800
And if you don't have free
speech and academic freedom,

00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:09.003
those views get reified,
they do not get challenged.

00:41:12.616 --> 00:41:16.530
It violates the fundamental
role of higher education

00:41:16.530 --> 00:41:19.893
institutions to have
any restrictions at all.

00:41:20.940 --> 00:41:22.383
That's number one.

00:41:23.700 --> 00:41:26.703
Number two, as I think I said earlier,

00:41:28.473 --> 00:41:31.470
if students are not allowed
to be frank with one another,

00:41:31.470 --> 00:41:33.570
they don't really learn about one another.

00:41:38.250 --> 00:41:42.120
I've given a lot of lectures
in which I have said,

00:41:42.120 --> 00:41:46.680
and I think students now understand it,

00:41:46.680 --> 00:41:48.450
I'm much more interested in hearing

00:41:48.450 --> 00:41:51.360
from the people who hate me
than the people who love me.

00:41:51.360 --> 00:41:54.390
I'm much more interested in
knowing who disagrees with me

00:41:54.390 --> 00:41:55.953
than people who agree with me.

00:41:56.910 --> 00:41:59.040
That's how I learn,

00:41:59.040 --> 00:42:01.260
and that's how they learn.

00:42:01.260 --> 00:42:02.943
The clash of ideas,

00:42:03.780 --> 00:42:06.130
which is the theory behind
the First Amendment.

00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:10.170
That truth will somehow
emerge, or if not truth,

00:42:10.170 --> 00:42:14.070
at least a better truth, a truer truth,

00:42:14.070 --> 00:42:19.070
a more useful truth, if
ideas are allowed to clash.

00:42:19.410 --> 00:42:22.200
- Especially in the structure
of a university where

00:42:22.200 --> 00:42:24.210
at least I would say
there's some set of rules,

00:42:24.210 --> 00:42:25.890
some set of civility.

00:42:25.890 --> 00:42:29.310
I think I would rather read "Mein Kampf"

00:42:29.310 --> 00:42:31.470
to understand people that hate.

00:42:31.470 --> 00:42:34.860
There is also a quality to disagreement

00:42:34.860 --> 00:42:36.180
that we should strive for.

00:42:36.180 --> 00:42:40.320
And I think a university is a
place where when disagreement

00:42:40.320 --> 00:42:44.940
and even hate is allowed, it's
done in a high effort way.

00:42:44.940 --> 00:42:47.740
- Somebody asked me once about what books

00:42:48.977 --> 00:42:52.950
would have as required
reading in literature courses,

00:42:52.950 --> 00:42:56.940
and I listed "Mein Kampf",
and they were horrified.

00:42:56.940 --> 00:42:58.980
And I said, "Well, it's one
of the most important books

00:42:58.980 --> 00:43:00.267
of the 20th century."

00:43:01.200 --> 00:43:03.420
I mean, six million Jews died,

00:43:03.420 --> 00:43:06.090
enormous number of other people died,

00:43:06.090 --> 00:43:08.310
because one guy wrote a
book called "Mein Kampf",

00:43:08.310 --> 00:43:10.500
and took it seriously.

00:43:10.500 --> 00:43:12.575
It's one of the most
important books ever written.

00:43:12.575 --> 00:43:15.810
How can an educated person

00:43:15.810 --> 00:43:19.647
not have at least breezed
through "Mein Kampf"?

00:43:20.970 --> 00:43:22.260
- It's not a great read, though.

00:43:22.260 --> 00:43:25.290
- It's not a great read.
He was not a great writer.

00:43:25.290 --> 00:43:29.550
But you do get a sense for the sociopath

00:43:29.550 --> 00:43:30.540
that was Adolf Hitler.

00:43:30.540 --> 00:43:33.930
- Yes, because he really acted
on the words that he wrote.

00:43:33.930 --> 00:43:35.220
- [Harvey] Yeah.

00:43:35.220 --> 00:43:39.150
- And it was there, and if
people took that work seriously,

00:43:39.150 --> 00:43:40.800
they would've understood.

00:43:40.800 --> 00:43:43.350
- It's one of the most important
books of the 20th century,

00:43:43.350 --> 00:43:47.010
and it's politically incorrect to read it.

00:43:47.010 --> 00:43:48.720
It's crazy.

00:43:48.720 --> 00:43:51.493
- But can you speak to the

00:43:54.360 --> 00:43:57.450
efforts to increase
diversity in universities,

00:43:57.450 --> 00:44:02.130
which I think is embodied in
this D-I-E effort of diversity,

00:44:02.130 --> 00:44:04.200
inclusion and equity programs.

00:44:04.200 --> 00:44:07.470
Where do they go right?
Where do they go wrong?

00:44:07.470 --> 00:44:09.450
- Okay, let me tell you, first of all.

00:44:09.450 --> 00:44:11.463
This may surprise a lot of people.

00:44:12.660 --> 00:44:15.303
I am opposed to affirmative action.

00:44:17.670 --> 00:44:21.660
And I think that what it does

00:44:21.660 --> 00:44:22.493
is it

00:44:23.460 --> 00:44:26.223
labels people by their race,

00:44:27.060 --> 00:44:28.710
by their religion,

00:44:28.710 --> 00:44:31.020
and by their national origin.

00:44:31.020 --> 00:44:33.810
Precisely what we don't want people to do

00:44:33.810 --> 00:44:37.590
is be pigeonholed in those categories.

00:44:37.590 --> 00:44:41.550
The reason that affirmative
action has become

00:44:41.550 --> 00:44:46.200
the way that universities
decide on who gets admitted

00:44:46.200 --> 00:44:48.210
is because, historically,

00:44:48.210 --> 00:44:51.930
people in what's called
"marginalized groups",

00:44:51.930 --> 00:44:55.743
Blacks, gays, Hispanics,

00:44:56.610 --> 00:45:00.483
have been discriminated against,
in the admissions process.

00:45:01.680 --> 00:45:05.550
Now, what I have suggested

00:45:05.550 --> 00:45:09.300
is that instead of affirmative
action, and by the way,

00:45:09.300 --> 00:45:10.380
here's a prediction.

00:45:10.380 --> 00:45:12.743
The Supreme Court is going to
abolish affirmative action.

00:45:12.743 --> 00:45:15.543
There's a case pending, this Harvard case.

00:45:18.870 --> 00:45:20.700
There are two cases joined together.

00:45:20.700 --> 00:45:23.940
One of a public university and
one of a private university.

00:45:23.940 --> 00:45:25.713
The private university is Harvard.

00:45:27.390 --> 00:45:30.270
I predict that the Supreme
Court will vote six to three

00:45:30.270 --> 00:45:31.893
to abolish affirmative action.

00:45:34.110 --> 00:45:36.840
On its face, it is a violation

00:45:36.840 --> 00:45:39.360
of equal protection of the law.

00:45:39.360 --> 00:45:44.360
Some groups are favored
because of race or ethnicity.

00:45:44.880 --> 00:45:49.200
It is a classic violation
of equal protection clause.

00:45:49.200 --> 00:45:52.323
When affirmative action was approved,

00:45:53.160 --> 00:45:56.910
the deciding vote was
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor.

00:45:56.910 --> 00:46:00.513
She wrote a very famous
opinion in which she said,

00:46:01.747 --> 00:46:06.420
"I am hesitate to vote
to affirm the notion

00:46:06.420 --> 00:46:09.060
of affirmative action
because it's such an obvious

00:46:09.060 --> 00:46:11.310
violation of equal protection.

00:46:11.310 --> 00:46:14.250
But we have an urgent
problem in the society.

00:46:14.250 --> 00:46:16.180
We are not educating our

00:46:18.270 --> 00:46:21.870
members of racial and ethnic minorities,

00:46:21.870 --> 00:46:25.473
and we have to try to get
them into our colleges.

00:46:26.580 --> 00:46:30.213
So, I think it should be
approved for 25 years.

00:46:36.545 --> 00:46:39.630
In 25 years, it should
have performed its role."

00:46:39.630 --> 00:46:41.250
Well, it hasn't.

00:46:41.250 --> 00:46:44.100
And the 25 years is coming up.

00:46:44.100 --> 00:46:47.340
I think it's three or four years left.

00:46:47.340 --> 00:46:49.230
The Supreme Court is going to abolish it.

00:46:49.230 --> 00:46:50.823
You can take my word for that.

00:46:51.720 --> 00:46:54.693
'Cause it is such an obvious
violation of equal protection.

00:46:55.648 --> 00:46:59.460
Why did affirmative action come into play?

00:46:59.460 --> 00:47:03.840
Because the secondary in
elementary schools were so bad.

00:47:03.840 --> 00:47:07.500
Public, secondary and
elementary schools were so bad.

00:47:07.500 --> 00:47:08.670
Why are they so bad?

00:47:08.670 --> 00:47:13.020
Partly because of the control
that the teachers union has.

00:47:13.020 --> 00:47:15.860
Randi Weingarten runs
the public school system

00:47:15.860 --> 00:47:17.073
in the United States.

00:47:18.180 --> 00:47:21.460
And what I have suggested is that

00:47:22.590 --> 00:47:26.310
the effort should be to...

00:47:26.310 --> 00:47:29.850
This is a national emergency,

00:47:29.850 --> 00:47:31.990
to improve

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:37.623
the quality of elementary
and secondary education.

00:47:38.460 --> 00:47:41.550
And one way to do it is to hire teachers

00:47:41.550 --> 00:47:43.710
who are fabulous teachers,

00:47:43.710 --> 00:47:46.383
rather than necessarily
members of the union.

00:47:47.400 --> 00:47:49.510
I have come to oppose

00:47:51.090 --> 00:47:54.270
public workers unions.

00:47:54.270 --> 00:47:58.170
I am a very strong supporter of unions

00:47:58.170 --> 00:48:00.180
in the private sector.

00:48:00.180 --> 00:48:03.930
Why do I think there's such
a difference between unions

00:48:03.930 --> 00:48:06.130
in the public sector
and the private sector?

00:48:06.981 --> 00:48:11.100
In the private sector,
management is arguing,

00:48:11.100 --> 00:48:13.440
bargaining with its own money,

00:48:13.440 --> 00:48:16.020
and with the money of shareholders.

00:48:16.020 --> 00:48:19.590
In the public sector,
there's only one side.

00:48:19.590 --> 00:48:21.330
There is the teachers union,

00:48:21.330 --> 00:48:23.430
and then there's a school
committee that is dealing

00:48:23.430 --> 00:48:25.803
with the taxpayers' money, not their own.

00:48:25.803 --> 00:48:28.660
And so it's a very skewed

00:48:30.510 --> 00:48:32.010
power balance.

00:48:32.010 --> 00:48:36.720
So, as supportive as I am
of private sector unions,

00:48:36.720 --> 00:48:40.410
I am in opposition of
public sector unions.

00:48:40.410 --> 00:48:42.390
They're very destructive.

00:48:42.390 --> 00:48:46.050
And I think without teachers union,

00:48:46.050 --> 00:48:50.100
teachers who are really skilled
will be able to get jobs.

00:48:50.100 --> 00:48:53.070
They would not have to worry
about the seniority of teachers

00:48:53.070 --> 00:48:58.070
who long since have given
up really creative teaching.

00:48:58.620 --> 00:49:02.253
And we have to improve the
public educational system.

00:49:05.520 --> 00:49:06.850
My late wife and I

00:49:09.450 --> 00:49:12.960
had a classmate of, we
have a son who's now 44,

00:49:12.960 --> 00:49:15.160
who went to the public
schools in Cambridge.

00:49:16.470 --> 00:49:21.000
He has a friend, first name Eugene,

00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:24.960
who was a Black kid from
Roxbury, whose mother understood

00:49:24.960 --> 00:49:26.760
that the schools in Roxbury were terrible,

00:49:26.760 --> 00:49:28.860
the schools in Cambridge were pretty good.

00:49:29.790 --> 00:49:31.443
He lived in our house,

00:49:33.690 --> 00:49:36.780
Monday to Friday, and he
went to school with Isaac

00:49:36.780 --> 00:49:38.380
in the Cambridge public schools.

00:49:40.020 --> 00:49:42.750
Elsa and I would show up to
school committee meetings

00:49:42.750 --> 00:49:46.470
when there was bargaining
between the teachers union

00:49:46.470 --> 00:49:48.177
and the school committee.

00:49:50.040 --> 00:49:52.923
The teachers union objected
to our being there.

00:49:54.210 --> 00:49:58.773
We argued, we're taxpayers.
We have a kid in the school.

00:50:00.450 --> 00:50:04.383
His best friend lives with us
and goes to school with him.

00:50:05.520 --> 00:50:06.813
We have a real interest.

00:50:08.640 --> 00:50:13.590
The school committee walked
out of the bargaining session.

00:50:13.590 --> 00:50:16.260
The city council then
reconsidered its vote

00:50:16.260 --> 00:50:19.293
and they voted that citizens,

00:50:20.550 --> 00:50:23.520
taxpayers, parents of kids in the school,

00:50:23.520 --> 00:50:28.520
could not show up to these
negotiation sessions.

00:50:28.650 --> 00:50:32.040
I thought that was absolutely outrageous.

00:50:32.040 --> 00:50:37.040
But I understood why, because
these contracts are crazy.

00:50:37.140 --> 00:50:40.680
No sane municipality

00:50:40.680 --> 00:50:43.353
should enter into some of these contracts.

00:50:44.550 --> 00:50:46.443
And so,

00:50:48.237 --> 00:50:50.220
I have become an opponent

00:50:50.220 --> 00:50:52.950
of the National Teachers Association,

00:50:52.950 --> 00:50:56.790
the Cambridge Teachers Association.

00:50:56.790 --> 00:51:00.340
I don't think there should be
unions for public employees

00:51:01.200 --> 00:51:04.440
because there's no real
bargaining going on,

00:51:04.440 --> 00:51:07.620
and I think that the public school system

00:51:07.620 --> 00:51:09.790
will never be improved, as long as the

00:51:11.460 --> 00:51:13.410
teachers are unionized.

00:51:13.410 --> 00:51:16.290
- So that, to you, is at
the core of the problem

00:51:16.290 --> 00:51:21.290
that results in the kind of
inequality of opportunity

00:51:21.780 --> 00:51:24.686
that affirmative action
is designed to solve.

00:51:24.686 --> 00:51:27.900
- If the educational
system in the elementary

00:51:27.900 --> 00:51:30.540
and high school levels is improved,

00:51:30.540 --> 00:51:32.700
we wouldn't need affirmative action.

00:51:32.700 --> 00:51:35.520
These kids would get good educations.

00:51:35.520 --> 00:51:37.710
- So, from all backgrounds,

00:51:37.710 --> 00:51:41.490
poor kids in the United States
would get good education,

00:51:41.490 --> 00:51:45.270
if public unions are abolished.

00:51:45.270 --> 00:51:46.220
- [Harvey] Correct.

00:51:47.156 --> 00:51:48.017
- But do you-

00:51:48.017 --> 00:51:49.530
- [Harvey] And incidentally,
the postal service

00:51:49.530 --> 00:51:51.605
would probably work better, too.

00:51:51.605 --> 00:51:53.010
(Lex chuckles)

00:51:53.010 --> 00:51:54.780
- That's a whole other conversation.

00:51:54.780 --> 00:51:58.320
But do you, at the core of
the problem of the inequality

00:51:58.320 --> 00:52:00.960
in universities,

00:52:00.960 --> 00:52:03.930
that diversity, inclusion
and equity programs

00:52:03.930 --> 00:52:06.630
they're trying to solve is
the public education system.

00:52:06.630 --> 00:52:08.700
- Correct.
- Secondary education.

00:52:08.700 --> 00:52:10.950
- [Harvey] Yes, correct.
Elementary and secondary.

00:52:10.950 --> 00:52:12.900
- Elementary and secondary education.

00:52:12.900 --> 00:52:16.680
- Well, then is there
use? What is the benefit?

00:52:16.680 --> 00:52:20.760
What is the drawback of D-I-E,

00:52:20.760 --> 00:52:22.740
diversity inclusion and equity programs,

00:52:22.740 --> 00:52:24.330
at universities like Harvard?

00:52:24.330 --> 00:52:27.270
- It's an affirmative action, basically.

00:52:27.270 --> 00:52:32.270
And what it does is it allows
the system of elementary

00:52:32.730 --> 00:52:35.220
and secondary education to be bad,

00:52:35.220 --> 00:52:38.340
because they could say, "Oh,
we got our kids into Harvard."

00:52:38.340 --> 00:52:40.173
Yes, but you haven't educated them.

00:52:41.280 --> 00:52:43.803
And it covers up the wound.

00:52:45.060 --> 00:52:47.310
And I think we will never improve,

00:52:47.310 --> 00:52:49.320
as long as we're able
to cover up the wound.

00:52:49.320 --> 00:52:51.960
And as I said, affirmative
action is gonna be abolished

00:52:51.960 --> 00:52:53.790
by the Supreme Court.

00:52:53.790 --> 00:52:56.133
It's a clear violation
of equal protection.

00:52:56.133 --> 00:53:00.963
It's what Sandra Day O'Connor
understood, but ignored,

00:53:02.130 --> 00:53:04.593
intentionally, but as an experiment.

00:53:05.550 --> 00:53:08.160
And I believe it's gonna be abolished.

00:53:08.160 --> 00:53:10.150
That that's gonna force

00:53:11.160 --> 00:53:15.330
the elementary and high
schools to get serious.

00:53:15.330 --> 00:53:18.330
- Do you see the same issues
that you discuss now at Harvard

00:53:19.170 --> 00:53:20.003
at MIT?

00:53:20.003 --> 00:53:21.780
We're here in Boston,
so I have to talk about

00:53:21.780 --> 00:53:23.640
the great universities here in Boston.

00:53:23.640 --> 00:53:25.053
You've written about MIT.

00:53:26.540 --> 00:53:29.820
It's the university I love.
I'm a research scientist there.

00:53:29.820 --> 00:53:31.440
Do you see the same kind of issues there?

00:53:31.440 --> 00:53:32.550
- Yes, I do.

00:53:32.550 --> 00:53:34.830
- Do you remember or
can you explain the case

00:53:34.830 --> 00:53:38.430
of Dorian Abbot lecture
that was canceled at MIT?

00:53:38.430 --> 00:53:42.600
- Yeah, well, this is not the only...

00:53:42.600 --> 00:53:45.120
It's not the only incident.

00:53:45.120 --> 00:53:47.520
There have been incidents
all around the country

00:53:48.930 --> 00:53:52.260
of academics, professors who have used,

00:53:52.260 --> 00:53:56.520
that don't comport with the,
as the great Lillian Hellman,

00:53:56.520 --> 00:53:59.433
another friend of my late wife, said,

00:54:01.560 --> 00:54:04.110
she said she refused to cut her garments,

00:54:04.110 --> 00:54:06.573
in order to fit the fashions of the day.

00:54:07.410 --> 00:54:10.560
Dorian Abbot didn't cut his suit

00:54:10.560 --> 00:54:14.400
to fit the fashions of the
day, his intellectual suit.

00:54:14.400 --> 00:54:17.640
And so this has happened at Princeton,

00:54:17.640 --> 00:54:21.180
this has happened at Harvard,
this has happened at MIT.

00:54:21.180 --> 00:54:25.410
The great universities in
the country have decided

00:54:25.410 --> 00:54:28.350
that the clash of ideas
is not such a good idea,

00:54:28.350 --> 00:54:31.680
because some people's
feelings will be hurt.

00:54:31.680 --> 00:54:35.343
Well, there was quite a revolt against it.

00:54:36.180 --> 00:54:37.013
FIRE

00:54:38.130 --> 00:54:40.620
sounded the alarm.

00:54:40.620 --> 00:54:43.590
And then, in the end,
the universities were,

00:54:43.590 --> 00:54:45.630
I believe Abbot was invited to come back.

00:54:45.630 --> 00:54:47.343
I think he turned them down.

00:54:48.930 --> 00:54:51.633
He shouldn't have turned
them down, but he did.

00:54:53.430 --> 00:54:58.230
And when the light is cast
upon these situations,

00:54:58.230 --> 00:55:01.170
the universities back down,
'cause they're so embarrassed.

00:55:01.170 --> 00:55:02.280
- [Lex] Yeah.

00:55:02.280 --> 00:55:04.830
- And the newspapers,
because newspapers depend

00:55:04.830 --> 00:55:08.190
on the First Amendment in order to exist,

00:55:08.190 --> 00:55:10.350
newspapers tend to give
pretty good publicity

00:55:10.350 --> 00:55:11.850
to these cases of censorship.

00:55:11.850 --> 00:55:13.650
- [Lex] So they grill the universities.

00:55:13.650 --> 00:55:14.520
- Yes.

00:55:14.520 --> 00:55:16.350
- [Lex] So they really emphasized,

00:55:16.350 --> 00:55:18.090
they catalyzed the embarrassment.

00:55:18.090 --> 00:55:18.923
- Yes.

00:55:18.923 --> 00:55:19.890
- [Lex] So is that one of the ways,

00:55:19.890 --> 00:55:21.660
is that the best way to fight all of this?

00:55:21.660 --> 00:55:24.900
- Yes. Sunshine is the best disinfectant.

00:55:24.900 --> 00:55:27.900
- You've written about MIT's
connection to Jeffrey Epstein.

00:55:27.900 --> 00:55:31.263
He was well connected
at MIT and at Harvard.

00:55:32.329 --> 00:55:36.060
What lessons do you
draw about human nature,

00:55:36.060 --> 00:55:39.480
about universities, about
all of this from this saga?

00:55:39.480 --> 00:55:40.593
- Let me say this.

00:55:41.610 --> 00:55:44.280
I believe that universities,

00:55:44.280 --> 00:55:48.120
if somebody was to, for
example, donate to a university

00:55:48.120 --> 00:55:51.300
and donates on the requirement

00:55:51.300 --> 00:55:54.108
that the building be named after them.

00:55:54.108 --> 00:55:57.199
If the university is taking donations

00:55:57.199 --> 00:56:00.656
and the person is funding a building,

00:56:00.656 --> 00:56:03.090
and wants the building named after them,

00:56:03.090 --> 00:56:06.330
the building should be named
after him, her or them.

00:56:06.330 --> 00:56:09.270
Harvard is facing this now
with the Sackler building

00:56:09.270 --> 00:56:12.240
because the Sacklers have become, now,

00:56:12.240 --> 00:56:14.910
a persona non grata because of their role

00:56:14.910 --> 00:56:18.930
in producing the opioids that caused huge,

00:56:18.930 --> 00:56:21.960
scandalous opioid addiction.

00:56:21.960 --> 00:56:25.320
There are people who want
to remove the name Sackler

00:56:25.320 --> 00:56:27.303
from the Sackler Art Museum at Harvard.

00:56:28.230 --> 00:56:32.970
Larry Bacow, the President
of Harvard, to his credit,

00:56:32.970 --> 00:56:35.643
has refused to do that.

00:56:37.260 --> 00:56:42.210
And if it reminds people
that the money was earned

00:56:42.210 --> 00:56:45.720
through selling opioids, that's good.

00:56:45.720 --> 00:56:47.400
That's good that people understand

00:56:47.400 --> 00:56:49.230
that that's where the
Sacklers got their money.

00:56:49.230 --> 00:56:50.703
They should be re reminded.

00:56:53.605 --> 00:56:57.180
In my undergraduate alma mater, Princeton,

00:56:57.180 --> 00:57:00.780
there's a movement to remove
the name Woodrow Wilson,

00:57:00.780 --> 00:57:02.910
because Wilson was president at Princeton,

00:57:02.910 --> 00:57:04.830
before he became governor of New Jersey,

00:57:04.830 --> 00:57:07.050
before he became President
of the United States.

00:57:07.050 --> 00:57:08.880
How he got to be Governor
of New Jersey was,

00:57:08.880 --> 00:57:11.970
he was so insufferable that
the trustees of Princeton

00:57:11.970 --> 00:57:15.270
got him the nomination to run
for Governor of New Jersey.

00:57:15.270 --> 00:57:17.770
They had said, "We gotta
get this guy outta here."

00:57:19.380 --> 00:57:23.130
And not 'cause he was
anti-Black and anti-Semitic,

00:57:23.130 --> 00:57:24.660
'cause the trustees were, as well,

00:57:24.660 --> 00:57:27.060
but because he just was insufferable,

00:57:27.060 --> 00:57:30.673
he drove the faculty crazy
and they got him out.

00:57:32.588 --> 00:57:37.020
And so Princeton was thinking
of changing the name.

00:57:37.020 --> 00:57:40.353
I wrote a letter to President
Eisgruber at Princeton saying,

00:57:41.407 --> 00:57:43.980
"This is part of the university's history.

00:57:43.980 --> 00:57:45.307
You don't wanna...

00:57:45.307 --> 00:57:48.720
You wanna rewrite history falsely?

00:57:48.720 --> 00:57:51.660
Woodrow Wilson was the
president of this institution.

00:57:51.660 --> 00:57:53.580
He was one of your predecessors."

00:57:53.580 --> 00:57:55.083
He never answered me, either.

00:57:56.160 --> 00:57:59.910
I think these people, they
know they have no answer.

00:57:59.910 --> 00:58:03.780
The reason I didn't get a
response from President Eisgruber

00:58:03.780 --> 00:58:06.000
is the same as the reason
I didn't get a response

00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:08.520
from the headmaster of Milton Academy.

00:58:08.520 --> 00:58:12.579
They understand that what
they're doing is violative

00:58:12.579 --> 00:58:16.350
of the fundamental precepts
of academic institutions.

00:58:16.350 --> 00:58:20.490
They're ashamed, yet they feel
they have no choice because

00:58:20.490 --> 00:58:23.610
they feel that they would
be criticized for racism,

00:58:23.610 --> 00:58:26.310
homophobia, blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

00:58:26.310 --> 00:58:28.260
- [Lex] Criticized by how many people?

00:58:28.260 --> 00:58:31.710
- Well, they feel that they
would be criticized by students

00:58:31.710 --> 00:58:33.810
and parents and donors.

00:58:33.810 --> 00:58:34.890
I disagree with that.

00:58:34.890 --> 00:58:37.260
I actually think there
are more people out there

00:58:37.260 --> 00:58:40.050
that agree with me than agree with them.

00:58:40.050 --> 00:58:41.490
- Yeah, by a large margin.

00:58:41.490 --> 00:58:44.850
- By a large margin, in
what I call the real world,

00:58:44.850 --> 00:58:47.430
which is the world outside the campus.

00:58:47.430 --> 00:58:50.730
But academics are afraid
they'd be criticized.

00:58:50.730 --> 00:58:52.230
They're incredibly thin skinned.

00:58:52.230 --> 00:58:54.900
When I say academics, I mean
academic administrators.

00:58:54.900 --> 00:58:57.420
They're very thin skinned,
politically correct.

00:58:57.420 --> 00:58:58.803
Holier than thou.

00:59:00.120 --> 00:59:03.390
As I said, I would fire 95% of them,

00:59:03.390 --> 00:59:07.680
and I would be more
careful in who I elected

00:59:07.680 --> 00:59:09.480
to lead these institutions.

00:59:09.480 --> 00:59:11.430
So, I said Claudine Gay is probably

00:59:11.430 --> 00:59:14.010
gonna be a disaster at Harvard.

00:59:14.010 --> 00:59:16.500
- So it takes guts, it takes courage,

00:59:16.500 --> 00:59:19.710
to be in the administration

00:59:19.710 --> 00:59:22.440
when the task of protecting
the freedom of speech is there.

00:59:22.440 --> 00:59:27.030
And also, which in part requires

00:59:27.030 --> 00:59:30.180
you to admit and to uphold the mistakes

00:59:30.180 --> 00:59:31.320
you have done in the past.

00:59:31.320 --> 00:59:33.150
- Correct!
- Not to hide them.

00:59:33.150 --> 00:59:33.990
- [Harvey] Correct.

00:59:33.990 --> 00:59:37.650
- And that, to you, I mean,
Jeffrey Epstein for Harvard,

00:59:37.650 --> 00:59:40.020
and for MIT is a very recent mistake.

00:59:40.020 --> 00:59:42.870
- Well, there's a debate
whether it's a mistake.

00:59:42.870 --> 00:59:44.520
They took money from him.

00:59:44.520 --> 00:59:45.543
- Yes.
- Okay.

00:59:46.410 --> 00:59:48.813
Is it a mistake to take
money from bad people?

00:59:50.438 --> 00:59:54.173
Do you have to do a morals
test of a potential donor?

00:59:55.200 --> 00:59:56.553
I don't think so.

00:59:58.200 --> 00:59:59.580
- It's complicated because-

00:59:59.580 --> 01:00:01.860
- If there are no
conditions attached to it,

01:00:01.860 --> 01:00:03.900
I think it's emotionally complicated.

01:00:03.900 --> 01:00:06.933
I don't think that it is
rationally complicated.

01:00:08.970 --> 01:00:10.440
It's emotionally complicated.

01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:13.623
It's particularly complicated
if they want naming rights.

01:00:15.487 --> 01:00:19.377
"The Jeffrey Epstein
Biological Laboratory".

01:00:20.742 --> 01:00:23.883
That would be a problem
for most universities.

01:00:24.930 --> 01:00:29.130
I don't think that naming
rights have to be given

01:00:29.130 --> 01:00:31.380
to somebody that you don't think

01:00:31.380 --> 01:00:32.790
is worthy of having their name.

01:00:32.790 --> 01:00:34.717
I think the university
has the right to say,

01:00:34.717 --> 01:00:37.710
"No, we'll take your
money, but we will not

01:00:37.710 --> 01:00:39.030
name the building after you."

01:00:39.030 --> 01:00:41.100
I think they have a right to do that.

01:00:41.100 --> 01:00:42.270
- There's some degree in which

01:00:42.270 --> 01:00:44.403
you whitewash the name, though.

01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:49.080
Not with naming rights, but...

01:00:49.080 --> 01:00:50.100
- [Harvey] If you take the money?

01:00:50.100 --> 01:00:52.803
- If you take the money,
it allows the person,

01:00:54.120 --> 01:00:57.390
in public discourse to say
that they're collaborating,

01:00:57.390 --> 01:00:59.490
they're working together
with Harvard and with MIT.

01:00:59.490 --> 01:01:02.250
- Well, I have a problem with universities

01:01:02.250 --> 01:01:06.360
making morals tests of donors,

01:01:06.360 --> 01:01:09.780
because not every donor
is as bad as Epstein,

01:01:09.780 --> 01:01:13.380
but some of the donors made
their money in industry,

01:01:13.380 --> 01:01:15.570
by being rapacious,

01:01:15.570 --> 01:01:20.570
by paying low wages, by exploiting people.

01:01:21.420 --> 01:01:24.660
- You can make the case that

01:01:24.660 --> 01:01:28.050
accepting money from the
Department of Defense, from DARPA,

01:01:28.050 --> 01:01:31.320
from the United States
organizations that contributed

01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:34.830
to waging war and killing
hundreds of thousands of civilians

01:01:34.830 --> 01:01:36.210
over the past few decades.

01:01:36.210 --> 01:01:37.140
- [Harvey] Correct.

01:01:37.140 --> 01:01:39.870
- Folks like the tenured
professor Noam Chomsky

01:01:39.870 --> 01:01:42.420
will make the case that is far more evil

01:01:42.420 --> 01:01:45.510
than accepting money from Jeffrey Epstein.

01:01:45.510 --> 01:01:46.343
- [Harvey] Yes.

01:01:48.030 --> 01:01:51.450
- Still, Jeffrey Epstein
is a known pedophile.

01:01:51.450 --> 01:01:52.283
- Yes.

01:01:53.610 --> 01:01:57.780
So, that's why I say I would
not give him naming rights.

01:01:57.780 --> 01:01:59.730
I think the university has the autonomy

01:01:59.730 --> 01:02:02.250
to not give naming rights,

01:02:02.250 --> 01:02:04.990
but I think that giving
morals tests to donors

01:02:05.910 --> 01:02:08.310
is a Pandora's box.

01:02:08.310 --> 01:02:09.900
- What do you think about the aftermath

01:02:09.900 --> 01:02:11.490
of the Jeffrey Epstein saga?

01:02:11.490 --> 01:02:12.870
It feels like...

01:02:12.870 --> 01:02:15.360
I'm not familiar with Harvard's response,

01:02:15.360 --> 01:02:17.350
but MIT's response seemed to

01:02:18.780 --> 01:02:21.030
fire a few scapegoats

01:02:21.030 --> 01:02:23.530
and it didn't seem like a genuine response

01:02:24.930 --> 01:02:29.340
to the evils that human
beings are capable of.

01:02:29.340 --> 01:02:33.120
Sort of like rising to the surface,

01:02:33.120 --> 01:02:35.430
the description in a fully transparent way

01:02:35.430 --> 01:02:38.160
of all the interactions that
happened with Jeffrey Epstein

01:02:38.160 --> 01:02:39.453
and what that means.

01:02:40.530 --> 01:02:43.440
Yeah, what that means
about the role of money

01:02:43.440 --> 01:02:45.300
in universities, what
that means about just

01:02:45.300 --> 01:02:46.817
human beings in power.

01:02:46.817 --> 01:02:50.730
- Money is essential to run a university.

01:02:50.730 --> 01:02:53.700
One of the reasons it's essential
is because the university

01:02:53.700 --> 01:02:56.370
is artificially,

01:02:56.370 --> 01:03:00.510
artificially requires
huge amounts of money,

01:03:00.510 --> 01:03:03.281
and that's partly because
of the administrative army

01:03:03.281 --> 01:03:07.150
that they support

01:03:08.040 --> 01:03:11.240
and they would be less dependent
on the Jeffrey Epsteins

01:03:11.240 --> 01:03:13.520
of the world if they didn't have...

01:03:14.970 --> 01:03:18.720
So, it's sort of all
part of the same circle.

01:03:18.720 --> 01:03:19.920
- But there's a tension here.

01:03:19.920 --> 01:03:22.050
You're saying we shouldn't be putting

01:03:22.050 --> 01:03:25.173
a morals test on money,
but actually if you make,

01:03:26.520 --> 01:03:28.170
if you expand the amount of money

01:03:28.170 --> 01:03:29.670
needed to run the university,

01:03:29.670 --> 01:03:31.950
you're going to make less and less,

01:03:31.950 --> 01:03:34.450
more and more unethical
decisions in terms of accepting-

01:03:34.450 --> 01:03:37.440
- And as I said, I am
flexible enough to say

01:03:37.440 --> 01:03:39.870
that I don't think I would
name a building after somebody

01:03:39.870 --> 01:03:40.770
who was truly evil.

01:03:40.770 --> 01:03:44.610
I think university has the right

01:03:44.610 --> 01:03:48.903
to limit the naming rights for a donor.

01:03:50.160 --> 01:03:53.607
If I was an absolutist, I
would not even say that,

01:03:53.607 --> 01:03:55.383
but I'm not an absolutist.

01:03:56.550 --> 01:03:58.143
I have my limits.

01:03:59.040 --> 01:04:00.190
And that's one of them.

01:04:01.087 --> 01:04:03.780
"The Jeffrey Epstein
Biological Laboratory".

01:04:03.780 --> 01:04:05.013
It's a little bit much.

01:04:05.940 --> 01:04:08.590
- It feels like there
should be moral requirements

01:04:11.886 --> 01:04:15.480
on who to accept money from,
but the concern you have

01:04:15.480 --> 01:04:19.890
was about who gets to decide
and what's the alternative?

01:04:19.890 --> 01:04:22.380
- Correct. I think
there is no alternative.

01:04:22.380 --> 01:04:25.710
I think that turning down a donation

01:04:25.710 --> 01:04:30.390
because you don't approve
of the conduct of the donor

01:04:30.390 --> 01:04:32.013
is a Pandora's box.

01:04:33.157 --> 01:04:36.000
(Lex breathes deeply)

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:39.090
- But I'm just sickened by the
fact that an evil human being

01:04:39.090 --> 01:04:42.753
was allowed to walk in the
halls of a university I love.

01:04:44.970 --> 01:04:46.110
So, what do we do with that?

01:04:46.110 --> 01:04:47.760
- Well, are you telling me

01:04:47.760 --> 01:04:49.050
that none of the students are evil?

01:04:49.050 --> 01:04:51.000
Are you telling me none of
the faculty members are evil?

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:54.000
Are you telling me some none
of the administrators are evil?

01:04:55.230 --> 01:04:56.850
- But that doesn't...

01:04:56.850 --> 01:04:58.530
Sure, sure.

01:04:58.530 --> 01:05:02.430
So, scapegoating saying
that Jeffrey Epstein is evil

01:05:02.430 --> 01:05:05.790
can help us forget, can
aid us in forgetting

01:05:05.790 --> 01:05:10.110
that there is other evil
in the world and some of it

01:05:10.110 --> 01:05:13.560
might be roaming, still, the
halls of MIT and Harvard.

01:05:13.560 --> 01:05:15.870
- Hey, listen, I won't tell you the name,

01:05:15.870 --> 01:05:19.200
but I represented somebody
in the MIT administration

01:05:19.200 --> 01:05:24.200
a few years ago who is charged
with sexual improprieties

01:05:25.080 --> 01:05:26.253
against students.

01:05:27.600 --> 01:05:30.363
And as a lawyer, I
represented that person.

01:05:31.680 --> 01:05:34.110
People said, "How could you represent..."

01:05:34.110 --> 01:05:36.630
Some of the people I
represent are bad people.

01:05:36.630 --> 01:05:38.340
Say, "How can you represent?"

01:05:38.340 --> 01:05:40.890
I said, "Well, if I was a cardiologist

01:05:40.890 --> 01:05:42.840
and this person had a
heart attack on the street

01:05:42.840 --> 01:05:44.910
and I didn't deliver CPR,

01:05:44.910 --> 01:05:47.640
I would have my license taken away."

01:05:47.640 --> 01:05:48.990
I'm a lawyer.

01:05:48.990 --> 01:05:50.850
The only difference between my obligation

01:05:50.850 --> 01:05:53.670
and the doctor's obligation
is the constitution

01:05:53.670 --> 01:05:56.070
gives people the right
to assistance of counsel.

01:05:56.968 --> 01:05:57.990
The Constitution says nothing

01:05:57.990 --> 01:06:00.420
about the assistance of cardiologists.

01:06:00.420 --> 01:06:04.590
I have a very high duty to
represent unpopular people.

01:06:04.590 --> 01:06:09.093
Well, I think I apply the same
test to the college donors.

01:06:10.110 --> 01:06:12.610
The university should
not have a morals test

01:06:13.710 --> 01:06:15.363
to whose money to take.

01:06:17.211 --> 01:06:21.003
I do draw a line about
naming rights of buildings.

01:06:22.200 --> 01:06:26.790
And as I say, that's an
inconsistency with my absolutism.

01:06:26.790 --> 01:06:30.570
But I just, emotionally, I
just can't deal with having,

01:06:30.570 --> 01:06:33.507
as I said, "The Jeffrey
Epstein Biological Laboratory".

01:06:34.380 --> 01:06:37.020
- Well, for me emotionally,
there's nothing that sickens me

01:06:37.020 --> 01:06:40.770
more in the university
than the abuse of power.

01:06:40.770 --> 01:06:42.690
- [Harvey] Right and there's
an awful lot of people

01:06:42.690 --> 01:06:44.550
who abuse power at the university.

01:06:44.550 --> 01:06:47.970
- And especially when it comes
to abuse power over students.

01:06:47.970 --> 01:06:49.410
So, sexual harassment.

01:06:49.410 --> 01:06:52.800
So, in the realm of sexual abuse of power,

01:06:52.800 --> 01:06:54.720
and all kinds of other.

01:06:54.720 --> 01:06:58.440
- Well, it is a crime to
use one's power position,

01:06:58.440 --> 01:07:00.720
in order to take sexual
advantage of a student.

01:07:00.720 --> 01:07:02.133
It's a crime.
- Yeah.

01:07:03.330 --> 01:07:05.013
- This is not a closed question.

01:07:05.910 --> 01:07:09.360
- Yeah, but there's a legal crime,

01:07:09.360 --> 01:07:12.000
and there's a deeply ethical crime,

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:15.120
and there's an emotional
response that I have.

01:07:15.120 --> 01:07:16.180
You are

01:07:17.130 --> 01:07:20.940
a good lawyer and perhaps a
good man to want to defend

01:07:20.940 --> 01:07:23.400
some folks who are evil in this world.

01:07:23.400 --> 01:07:26.130
I don't think I have
that emotional fortitude.

01:07:26.130 --> 01:07:26.963
- [Harvey] Well, then you shouldn't be

01:07:26.963 --> 01:07:30.240
a criminal defense lawyer,
or a cardiologist. (laughs)

01:07:30.240 --> 01:07:31.592
- I think you're right.

01:07:31.592 --> 01:07:32.760
(both laugh)

01:07:32.760 --> 01:07:36.420
I'm still deeply sickened
by Jeffrey Epstein

01:07:36.420 --> 01:07:39.450
and the faculty, the administration

01:07:39.450 --> 01:07:42.090
that still might be in these
great American universities

01:07:42.090 --> 01:07:45.450
that are abusing their power,
in small ways and big ways.

01:07:45.450 --> 01:07:47.070
But that's human nature.

01:07:47.070 --> 01:07:48.660
You get a little bit of power,

01:07:48.660 --> 01:07:51.270
and you're a bad man or a bad woman,

01:07:51.270 --> 01:07:52.620
and you take advantage of it.

01:07:52.620 --> 01:07:53.460
- [Harvey] Yep.

01:07:53.460 --> 01:07:54.990
- We see that in the smallest of ways,

01:07:54.990 --> 01:07:56.340
and in the biggest of ways.

01:07:57.240 --> 01:08:01.473
In institutions and regimes,
all across the world.

01:08:03.392 --> 01:08:04.500
(sighs) Boy.

01:08:04.500 --> 01:08:07.200
Harvey, it's a complicated situation.

01:08:07.200 --> 01:08:08.850
- Well, it's a complicated world,

01:08:08.850 --> 01:08:11.370
and it's complicated to be a human being,

01:08:11.370 --> 01:08:12.960
and this is nothing new.

01:08:12.960 --> 01:08:16.083
- And we should talk about
it, without restriction.

01:08:16.980 --> 01:08:19.470
All right. Just to linger on liberal arts.

01:08:19.470 --> 01:08:22.860
In 2014, and probably still today,

01:08:22.860 --> 01:08:25.590
you wrote that liberals are
killing the liberal arts.

01:08:25.590 --> 01:08:27.570
- Yes.
- So can you explain?

01:08:27.570 --> 01:08:30.243
- Yes. I'm a political liberal.

01:08:31.530 --> 01:08:35.380
The problem with the political left

01:08:36.450 --> 01:08:39.420
is that it has divided

01:08:39.420 --> 01:08:43.917
between what's called
"progressives" and "liberals".

01:08:44.850 --> 01:08:48.900
Liberals are people of
the left who believe in

01:08:48.900 --> 01:08:52.290
the First Amendment, an
absolute First Amendment,

01:08:52.290 --> 01:08:54.123
and in due process of law.

01:08:57.570 --> 01:09:01.500
The problem with progressives now

01:09:01.500 --> 01:09:04.890
in the pursuit of equality,

01:09:04.890 --> 01:09:06.900
what they view as equality,

01:09:06.900 --> 01:09:09.780
they're willing to bend those rules.

01:09:09.780 --> 01:09:13.323
And this movement actually
started in Brandeis.

01:09:17.100 --> 01:09:18.933
It's the critical race theory.

01:09:20.850 --> 01:09:23.940
Herbert Marcuse was a
professor at Brandeis

01:09:23.940 --> 01:09:26.520
and he came up with this theory.

01:09:26.520 --> 01:09:30.360
The theory was this. This
is right out of Orwell.

01:09:30.360 --> 01:09:33.030
In order to create true equality

01:09:33.030 --> 01:09:35.550
in a society where you
have some downtrodden

01:09:35.550 --> 01:09:38.910
and some who are the ubermenschen,

01:09:38.910 --> 01:09:43.290
in order to create real equality,

01:09:43.290 --> 01:09:48.120
you have to reduce the
rights of the upper classes,

01:09:48.120 --> 01:09:52.863
and artificially increase the
rights of the lower classes.

01:09:55.200 --> 01:09:56.913
That will produce,

01:09:59.010 --> 01:10:02.310
out of unequal treatment,

01:10:02.310 --> 01:10:06.210
true equality will be attained.

01:10:06.210 --> 01:10:07.743
This is nonsense.

01:10:09.480 --> 01:10:13.380
The idea of discrimination

01:10:13.380 --> 01:10:16.920
producing true equality is nonsense.

01:10:16.920 --> 01:10:21.750
My view is, as I've said
earlier in our discussion,

01:10:21.750 --> 01:10:23.350
that the way to

01:10:24.540 --> 01:10:26.730
increase the

01:10:26.730 --> 01:10:31.170
opportunities for the lower classes

01:10:31.170 --> 01:10:34.320
is to give them real educations.

01:10:34.320 --> 01:10:38.340
And until we do that,
it's not gonna happen.

01:10:38.340 --> 01:10:40.900
And in order to do that,
we have to overcome

01:10:42.360 --> 01:10:46.350
the problem of the teachers
unions at the elementary

01:10:46.350 --> 01:10:48.900
and secondary school levels.

01:10:48.900 --> 01:10:52.320
Until we're willing to do that honestly,

01:10:52.320 --> 01:10:55.560
and improve those schools,

01:10:55.560 --> 01:10:59.820
we're gonna have a problem
of large number of uneducated

01:10:59.820 --> 01:11:02.370
people who need a boost

01:11:02.370 --> 01:11:05.910
because we haven't given
them proper educations.

01:11:05.910 --> 01:11:07.680
- What do you think about
some of the more controversial

01:11:07.680 --> 01:11:08.730
faculty in the world?

01:11:08.730 --> 01:11:11.970
So, an example of somebody
I've spoken with many times,

01:11:11.970 --> 01:11:14.220
on mic and offline, is Jordan Peterson.

01:11:14.220 --> 01:11:16.260
I'm not sure if you're
familiar with his work.

01:11:16.260 --> 01:11:18.870
But he is an outspoken critic of,

01:11:18.870 --> 01:11:20.790
or proponent of free speech on campus,

01:11:20.790 --> 01:11:22.980
and he's been attacked quite a bit.

01:11:22.980 --> 01:11:24.483
He's a controversial figure.

01:11:25.440 --> 01:11:27.780
What's the role of the
university to protect

01:11:27.780 --> 01:11:29.190
the Jordan Petersons of the world?

01:11:29.190 --> 01:11:33.090
- I think the university
has an absolute, absolute,

01:11:33.090 --> 01:11:35.380
not relative, that absolute

01:11:36.450 --> 01:11:39.450
obligation to protect the academic freedom

01:11:39.450 --> 01:11:43.233
of even the most
controversial faculty members.

01:11:44.220 --> 01:11:48.210
And you can imagine,
on a university campus,

01:11:48.210 --> 01:11:50.970
you have more people who are outliers

01:11:50.970 --> 01:11:53.373
than you do in the general population.

01:11:56.340 --> 01:11:57.840
- [Lex] That's the hope, at least.

01:11:57.840 --> 01:11:58.833
- Hopefully. Yeah.

01:12:01.093 --> 01:12:03.273
And those outliers have to be protected.

01:12:04.530 --> 01:12:06.540
They can't be pressured,
they can't be fired,

01:12:06.540 --> 01:12:11.540
they can't be disabled
from spewing their views,

01:12:11.580 --> 01:12:13.050
whether they're considered racist,

01:12:13.050 --> 01:12:17.419
whether they're considered
to promote an idea

01:12:17.419 --> 01:12:21.273
of human society that's
considered obnoxious.

01:12:22.860 --> 01:12:23.880
It doesn't matter.

01:12:23.880 --> 01:12:27.950
If you can't have freedom of thought

01:12:27.950 --> 01:12:31.620
on the college campuses, where can you?

01:12:31.620 --> 01:12:34.140
Then we're lost. As a society, we're lost.

01:12:34.140 --> 01:12:37.530
And as an educational institution,

01:12:37.530 --> 01:12:40.110
educational institutions
no longer will educate.

01:12:40.110 --> 01:12:42.120
They will indoctrinate.

01:12:42.120 --> 01:12:44.160
That, we have to avoid at all costs.

01:12:44.160 --> 01:12:46.650
- And we should also
remember that the outlier

01:12:46.650 --> 01:12:49.920
might also be the only bearer of truth.

01:12:49.920 --> 01:12:54.900
So, in Nazi Germany, speaking
against the fascist regime.

01:12:54.900 --> 01:12:58.500
In communist Soviet Union,
speaking against communism.

01:12:58.500 --> 01:13:02.490
They might hold the key to the solving

01:13:02.490 --> 01:13:03.660
the ailments of that society.

01:13:03.660 --> 01:13:04.980
- Absolutely.

01:13:04.980 --> 01:13:07.680
And some of the most important
discoveries in science,

01:13:07.680 --> 01:13:08.513
for example,

01:13:10.706 --> 01:13:13.800
were mocked at the beginning.

01:13:13.800 --> 01:13:16.627
I mean, think of poor Charlie Darwin.

01:13:16.627 --> 01:13:18.360
- "Charlie". (chuckles)

01:13:18.360 --> 01:13:21.780
I see he is on nickname levels with you.

01:13:21.780 --> 01:13:24.300
Well, 'cause we're talking
about these big topics

01:13:24.300 --> 01:13:26.360
of sexism or racism and hate.

01:13:26.360 --> 01:13:28.410
We should not forget
about the smaller topics,

01:13:28.410 --> 01:13:30.360
which might even have
the much bigger impact,

01:13:30.360 --> 01:13:33.280
which is what you're speaking to, which is

01:13:34.770 --> 01:13:35.980
outlier

01:13:37.110 --> 01:13:38.490
ideas in science.

01:13:38.490 --> 01:13:43.110
So, basically welcoming
controversial ideas in science.

01:13:43.110 --> 01:13:45.420
And by "controversial", I mean just stuff

01:13:45.420 --> 01:13:48.840
that most of the community
doesn't agree on.

01:13:48.840 --> 01:13:50.850
It doesn't actually harm anyone at all.

01:13:50.850 --> 01:13:53.100
But even then, there's always pressure.

01:13:53.100 --> 01:13:54.780
One of the things I'm
really concerned about

01:13:54.780 --> 01:13:58.230
is how little power young faculty have.

01:13:58.230 --> 01:14:00.813
That there's a kind of
hierarchy, seniority,

01:14:01.800 --> 01:14:05.520
that universities have,
empowered by the administration,

01:14:05.520 --> 01:14:10.320
where young faculty that
come in, they're kind of, um-

01:14:10.320 --> 01:14:11.820
- [Harvey] Pre-tenured.

01:14:11.820 --> 01:14:16.110
- Yeah, there's a
process in chasing tenure

01:14:16.110 --> 01:14:18.690
where you're kind of supposed to behave,

01:14:18.690 --> 01:14:21.900
and there's an incentive
to kind of fit in,

01:14:21.900 --> 01:14:23.760
and to not be an outcast,

01:14:23.760 --> 01:14:27.360
and that's a really huge
problem because, oftentimes,

01:14:27.360 --> 01:14:31.440
the youth is when the
craziest, the biggest ideas,

01:14:31.440 --> 01:14:34.950
the revolutionary ideas come
and if you're forced to behave

01:14:34.950 --> 01:14:37.500
and fit in and not speak out,

01:14:37.500 --> 01:14:39.810
then even in the realm of science,

01:14:39.810 --> 01:14:41.370
the innovation is stifled.

01:14:41.370 --> 01:14:46.200
- Well, now you trigger my,
happy to tell you this story.

01:14:46.200 --> 01:14:48.540
- [Lex] You're triggered. This is good.

01:14:48.540 --> 01:14:52.050
- In the mid 1980s, I
decided to take a four-month

01:14:52.050 --> 01:14:53.940
sabbatical from my law practice.

01:14:53.940 --> 01:14:55.290
- [Lex] Yes.

01:14:55.290 --> 01:14:57.120
- Professor James Vorenberg,

01:14:57.120 --> 01:14:59.940
who was at the time Dean
of the Harvard Law School,

01:14:59.940 --> 01:15:02.820
heard about it, heard
about it from his wife,

01:15:02.820 --> 01:15:06.780
Elizabeth Betty Vorenberg,
whom I was very friendly with,

01:15:06.780 --> 01:15:10.950
because we were both on the
ACLU of Massachusetts board,

01:15:10.950 --> 01:15:11.783
at the time.

01:15:12.720 --> 01:15:17.720
And so Betty told Jim that
Harvey was taking a sabbatical.

01:15:19.590 --> 01:15:23.550
Jim called Harvey and asked
Harvey if he would like to teach

01:15:23.550 --> 01:15:27.630
a course at the Harvard Law
School because there was nobody

01:15:27.630 --> 01:15:32.490
who had teaching criminal
law from the perspective

01:15:32.490 --> 01:15:35.940
of somebody who actually
was in court and litigated.

01:15:35.940 --> 01:15:37.233
It was all theoretical.

01:15:38.310 --> 01:15:39.687
I said, "Sure, I'll do it."

01:15:40.560 --> 01:15:43.353
So, I taught a semester
at Harvard Law School.

01:15:44.190 --> 01:15:46.890
The student evaluations
were fabulous. Why?

01:15:46.890 --> 01:15:48.270
Because it was really interesting.

01:15:48.270 --> 01:15:51.270
They were hearing a lawyer
who's talking about real cases.

01:15:51.270 --> 01:15:53.340
I actually brought in a few of my clients

01:15:53.340 --> 01:15:55.980
to some of the classes.

01:15:55.980 --> 01:15:58.627
And so Jim called me in and said,

01:15:58.627 --> 01:16:01.290
"Harvey, the students love this course.

01:16:01.290 --> 01:16:02.190
I'd like to offer you

01:16:02.190 --> 01:16:05.280
a tenure track position at the law school.

01:16:05.280 --> 01:16:06.780
You'd have to give up your law practice."

01:16:06.780 --> 01:16:08.580
I turned him down.

01:16:08.580 --> 01:16:11.280
He said, "Did you just say 'No'?"

01:16:11.280 --> 01:16:13.620
I said, "Yes, I said, 'No.'"

01:16:13.620 --> 01:16:14.580
He said, "How come?"

01:16:14.580 --> 01:16:18.480
He says, "Nobody in my administration

01:16:18.480 --> 01:16:20.850
has ever turned down a tenure track offer

01:16:20.850 --> 01:16:22.728
at Harvard Law School."

01:16:22.728 --> 01:16:27.150
I said, "Because I could
see that I'm not a good fit.

01:16:27.150 --> 01:16:32.150
That the administrators
are overrun the place.

01:16:32.430 --> 01:16:35.190
That faculty members,
especially untenured,

01:16:35.190 --> 01:16:37.290
are afraid to say things

01:16:37.290 --> 01:16:40.593
that might not help them
in the tenure quest.

01:16:43.226 --> 01:16:45.300
It's not a good fit for me."

01:16:45.300 --> 01:16:47.910
- [Lex] You saw this in
the mid 1980s, already?

01:16:47.910 --> 01:16:49.020
- Yes, about 1985.

01:16:50.520 --> 01:16:53.880
And I went back to my law practice.

01:16:53.880 --> 01:16:58.080
I did not want to get
into this meat grinder

01:16:58.080 --> 01:16:59.400
that I saw.

01:16:59.400 --> 01:17:02.520
Actually, I started to see it,

01:17:02.520 --> 01:17:04.110
before the turn of the century,

01:17:04.110 --> 01:17:07.233
because I co-authored "The
Shadow University" in '98,

01:17:08.100 --> 01:17:11.100
and then co-founded FIRE in '99.

01:17:11.100 --> 01:17:14.823
I'm an early student of this phenomenon.

01:17:15.750 --> 01:17:17.767
- What are some other
aspects of this, the book,

01:17:17.767 --> 01:17:21.540
"The Shadow University",
that we may have not covered?

01:17:21.540 --> 01:17:23.430
- Well, let me tell you a story.

01:17:23.430 --> 01:17:24.767
I believe I tell it in
"The Shadow University",

01:17:24.767 --> 01:17:26.670
'cause it was part of-

01:17:26.670 --> 01:17:28.470
- [Lex] I'm loving these stories, Harvey.

01:17:28.470 --> 01:17:30.660
- The stories are fabulous.

01:17:30.660 --> 01:17:32.210
Let me tell you a story of...

01:17:34.164 --> 01:17:37.683
I did a tour of the
country, visiting campuses.

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.757
I visited a college
called Hamline University.

01:17:41.757 --> 01:17:45.120
I believe it was in Indiana or Illinois.

01:17:45.120 --> 01:17:46.383
Somewhere in the Midwest.

01:17:47.250 --> 01:17:50.520
And I attended a freshman orientation.

01:17:50.520 --> 01:17:51.813
Now, listen to this.

01:17:53.070 --> 01:17:55.620
This was a freshman orientation.

01:17:55.620 --> 01:17:56.943
The administrators,

01:17:58.560 --> 01:17:59.997
the deans and the deanettes,

01:17:59.997 --> 01:18:02.547
and the deputy assistant
deans and deanettes,

01:18:02.547 --> 01:18:06.660
and the third-deputy
assistant deans and deanettes,

01:18:06.660 --> 01:18:10.530
lined the students up,
according to their skin hues.

01:18:10.530 --> 01:18:11.460
- [Lex] Oh, boy.

01:18:11.460 --> 01:18:16.230
- The blonde, blue-eyed
white folks were at one end.

01:18:16.230 --> 01:18:17.440
The darkest

01:18:21.450 --> 01:18:25.740
African Americans whose
bloodlines had not yet

01:18:25.740 --> 01:18:28.623
mixed with any of the
whites, on the other end.

01:18:29.970 --> 01:18:34.620
And the exercise was, you
had to tell how your race

01:18:34.620 --> 01:18:38.763
affected your success in
life, up until that point.

01:18:41.370 --> 01:18:44.850
I thought it was the most demeaning thing

01:18:44.850 --> 01:18:47.340
that one could imagine.

01:18:47.340 --> 01:18:48.660
Demeaning.

01:18:48.660 --> 01:18:50.167
I thought to myself,

01:18:50.167 --> 01:18:53.070
"They could do the same
about sexual orientation.

01:18:53.070 --> 01:18:55.050
They could do the same about religion.

01:18:55.050 --> 01:18:57.060
They could do the same
about national origin.

01:18:57.060 --> 01:19:00.120
It would be demeaning, no matter what."

01:19:00.120 --> 01:19:01.753
- [Lex] Yeah.

01:19:01.753 --> 01:19:03.310
- And the students actually

01:19:04.680 --> 01:19:08.250
verbalized how their race

01:19:08.250 --> 01:19:10.530
had either been a plus or a minus.

01:19:10.530 --> 01:19:12.600
- They did it?
- They did.

01:19:12.600 --> 01:19:14.340
And I thought it was so demeaning.

01:19:14.340 --> 01:19:19.340
It just confirmed all of my
distaste for this kind of,

01:19:20.670 --> 01:19:22.320
this kind of approach.

01:19:22.320 --> 01:19:24.180
- Let me ask you from
the interviewer seat.

01:19:24.180 --> 01:19:29.180
So, I get to do this podcast
and I often have to think about

01:19:30.600 --> 01:19:34.980
giving a large platform
and having a conversation

01:19:34.980 --> 01:19:37.230
with very controversial figures,

01:19:37.230 --> 01:19:41.223
and the level of controversy
has been slowly increasing.

01:19:42.060 --> 01:19:45.810
What's the role of this medium,

01:19:45.810 --> 01:19:47.043
to you?

01:19:48.030 --> 01:19:50.310
This medium of speech between two people,

01:19:50.310 --> 01:19:52.200
and me speaking with a
controversial figure.

01:19:52.200 --> 01:19:54.210
Me, or some other interviewer.

01:19:54.210 --> 01:19:57.930
What's the role of giving
platform to controversial figures?

01:19:57.930 --> 01:20:01.320
Say, members of the KKK,

01:20:01.320 --> 01:20:02.553
or dictators,

01:20:03.960 --> 01:20:05.850
people who are seen as evil?

01:20:05.850 --> 01:20:09.660
- Well, we want face
the world with reality.

01:20:09.660 --> 01:20:13.366
And the reality is that
there is some unpleasantness,

01:20:13.366 --> 01:20:16.140
unpleasantnesses in the world.

01:20:16.140 --> 01:20:18.120
Running from genocide,

01:20:18.120 --> 01:20:23.120
right through to ordinary
discrimination, to offensiveness.

01:20:23.670 --> 01:20:26.850
It's the real world, as we know it exists.

01:20:26.850 --> 01:20:28.413
Are we afraid to say it?

01:20:29.370 --> 01:20:31.980
Do we wanna make people
think that we live in a world

01:20:31.980 --> 01:20:34.080
where those words are not used?

01:20:34.080 --> 01:20:36.603
Where those animosities don't exist?

01:20:38.040 --> 01:20:39.240
The answer is no.

01:20:39.240 --> 01:20:40.380
- But you can whitewash,

01:20:40.380 --> 01:20:42.030
you can normalize the use of those words,

01:20:42.030 --> 01:20:45.870
and you can whitewash the
acceptability of certain leaders.

01:20:45.870 --> 01:20:50.831
So, for example, interviewing
Hitler in 1938, 1935, 1936,

01:20:50.831 --> 01:20:54.090
1937, '38, those are all
different dynamics there,

01:20:54.090 --> 01:20:58.080
but you can normalize this
person, and in so doing,

01:20:58.080 --> 01:21:00.450
create enormous harm.

01:21:00.450 --> 01:21:02.460
- Well, see, I don't
see it as normalizing.

01:21:02.460 --> 01:21:04.680
I see it as exposing.

01:21:04.680 --> 01:21:07.803
If more people had taken
"Mein Kampf" seriously,

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.793
Franklin Roosevelt
would've acted much sooner.

01:21:12.690 --> 01:21:15.570
He only got us into the war,

01:21:15.570 --> 01:21:17.730
asked Congress get us into the war,

01:21:17.730 --> 01:21:19.350
when the Japanese made the mistake

01:21:19.350 --> 01:21:20.853
of attacking Pearl Harbor.

01:21:22.680 --> 01:21:25.890
But there were some people
in the State Department,

01:21:25.890 --> 01:21:27.690
there were some people
in the administration

01:21:27.690 --> 01:21:31.230
who were trying to get Roosevelt

01:21:31.230 --> 01:21:34.170
to see what Hitler was really like,

01:21:34.170 --> 01:21:35.787
and he was blind to it!

01:21:35.787 --> 01:21:37.770
And this was one of
the greatest presidents

01:21:37.770 --> 01:21:39.630
the United States ever had.

01:21:39.630 --> 01:21:43.920
He was blind to it, until the Japanese

01:21:43.920 --> 01:21:46.380
attacked Pearl Harbor.

01:21:46.380 --> 01:21:51.000
So, I think that words, unpleasant ideas,

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:52.770
as expressed by words

01:21:52.770 --> 01:21:57.770
are essential for communicating
fact and truth and reality.

01:21:59.130 --> 01:22:01.710
And that's why I think that we should not

01:22:01.710 --> 01:22:03.900
whitewash language.

01:22:03.900 --> 01:22:06.660
We should not whitewash the
fact that Jeffrey Epstein

01:22:06.660 --> 01:22:09.240
was pretty close to MIT.

01:22:09.240 --> 01:22:10.953
- And Harvard.
- And Harvard.

01:22:12.420 --> 01:22:17.340
And reality, reality
actually means something.

01:22:17.340 --> 01:22:18.960
- Yeah, but from the
role of the interviewer,

01:22:18.960 --> 01:22:21.600
that's something I have
to think a lot about.

01:22:21.600 --> 01:22:24.733
Whether interviewing Hitler,
you said "exposing"...

01:22:26.190 --> 01:22:29.820
I think it's hard to know
what Hitler's like in a room,

01:22:29.820 --> 01:22:33.420
but it's also hard to know,
I've never met Jeffrey Epstein,

01:22:33.420 --> 01:22:36.750
it's hard to know what Jeffrey
Epstein's like in a room,

01:22:36.750 --> 01:22:40.200
but I imagine, to some degree
they're charismatic figures.

01:22:40.200 --> 01:22:43.050
So exposing them in the interview setting

01:22:43.050 --> 01:22:44.940
is not an easy task.

01:22:44.940 --> 01:22:47.820
- Well, interviewing is not an easy-

01:22:47.820 --> 01:22:49.260
- All right.
- Job.

01:22:49.260 --> 01:22:50.093
- [Lex] Yeah.

01:22:51.090 --> 01:22:52.710
- [Harvey] It's not a good idea

01:22:52.710 --> 01:22:54.513
to have an interviewer be an idiot.

01:22:56.189 --> 01:22:59.100
(Lex laughs)

01:22:59.100 --> 01:23:00.450
- I know exactly what you're saying,

01:23:00.450 --> 01:23:03.330
and I know why you're looking
at me directly as you say it.

01:23:03.330 --> 01:23:06.630
I appreciate that, Harvey.
All right. (chuckles)

01:23:06.630 --> 01:23:09.843
Let me ask about your
friend, your colleague,

01:23:10.680 --> 01:23:12.390
Alan Dershowitz.

01:23:12.390 --> 01:23:15.510
And I'll also ask about your
review of his most recent book.

01:23:15.510 --> 01:23:17.440
But before then, it'd be interesting

01:23:18.750 --> 01:23:21.630
to ask what you think of him
as a human being, as a lawyer.

01:23:21.630 --> 01:23:24.090
He's quite an interesting case.

01:23:24.090 --> 01:23:25.290
He's represented some of the most

01:23:25.290 --> 01:23:26.123
controversial figures in history.

01:23:26.123 --> 01:23:28.950
- Including Jeffrey Epstein.
- Including Jeffrey Epstein.

01:23:28.950 --> 01:23:32.640
Mike Tyson, Julian Assange, Jim Baker,

01:23:32.640 --> 01:23:36.390
and Jeffrey Epstein,
and even Donald Trump.

01:23:36.390 --> 01:23:38.130
So, he's an interesting figure.

01:23:38.130 --> 01:23:38.970
What do you think about that?

01:23:38.970 --> 01:23:40.113
- Claus von Bulow.

01:23:41.816 --> 01:23:42.738
- What do you think?

01:23:42.738 --> 01:23:45.330
What do you think about him
as a human being, as a lawyer?

01:23:45.330 --> 01:23:48.930
What he represents, in
terms of values and ideals?

01:23:48.930 --> 01:23:51.270
- Well, he is a criminal defense lawyer,

01:23:51.270 --> 01:23:53.820
and the job of a criminal defense lawyer

01:23:53.820 --> 01:23:56.433
is to represent accused criminals.

01:23:58.818 --> 01:24:01.173
He is a lifelong Democrat.

01:24:02.040 --> 01:24:03.090
He didn't represent Trump

01:24:03.090 --> 01:24:05.250
because he agrees with him politically.

01:24:05.250 --> 01:24:06.810
- Voted for Hillary, I believe you wrote.

01:24:06.810 --> 01:24:09.540
- He voted for Hillary.
Yes, that's what he says.

01:24:09.540 --> 01:24:12.783
And I absolutely believe
it. He's a liberal Democrat.

01:24:14.610 --> 01:24:17.970
But he's a criminal defense
lawyer, as well as a professor.

01:24:17.970 --> 01:24:22.620
And I've represented some very
nasty people, in my career.

01:24:25.200 --> 01:24:28.050
I wouldn't go out for coffee with them,

01:24:28.050 --> 01:24:31.563
but they have constitutional
rights to representation.

01:24:32.400 --> 01:24:33.870
- [Lex] And you take that very seriously.

01:24:33.870 --> 01:24:35.850
- Yes, you notice something that people

01:24:35.850 --> 01:24:38.013
don't understand about Dershowitz.

01:24:38.940 --> 01:24:41.610
He was asked by Trump to represent him

01:24:41.610 --> 01:24:44.010
in the second impeachment, as well.

01:24:44.010 --> 01:24:47.640
He turned him down. Why do
you think he turned him down?

01:24:47.640 --> 01:24:49.590
- So, people should know
he represented Trump

01:24:49.590 --> 01:24:50.520
in the first impeachment.

01:24:50.520 --> 01:24:53.010
- He represented him, only in the first,

01:24:53.010 --> 01:24:54.270
and he was successful,

01:24:54.270 --> 01:24:56.070
and when Trump was
impeached the second time,

01:24:56.070 --> 01:24:57.723
he asked Alan to represent him.

01:24:59.520 --> 01:25:01.530
Alan has had a lifelong policy

01:25:01.530 --> 01:25:04.230
of only representing somebody once.

01:25:04.230 --> 01:25:05.490
Never twice.

01:25:05.490 --> 01:25:06.870
Why?

01:25:06.870 --> 01:25:09.720
Because he never wanted to be
house counsel to the mafia.

01:25:12.180 --> 01:25:15.990
So, he early on had this position.

01:25:15.990 --> 01:25:18.030
He only represents somebody once.

01:25:18.030 --> 01:25:22.230
The mafia wants a lawyer
who's an in-house counsel

01:25:22.230 --> 01:25:24.453
who represents them in all their cases.

01:25:25.500 --> 01:25:28.860
So, that's the reason and
Alan never publicly explained

01:25:28.860 --> 01:25:31.110
that I know it's a fact,
'cause I've known him

01:25:31.110 --> 01:25:33.920
from the day that we met at
Harvard Law School in 1964.

01:25:33.920 --> 01:25:36.060
He was a first-year professor.

01:25:36.060 --> 01:25:37.650
I was a first-year student.

01:25:37.650 --> 01:25:40.443
We both had Brooklyn
accents and we hit it off.

01:25:41.400 --> 01:25:43.500
We've been close friends, ever since.

01:25:43.500 --> 01:25:45.810
- So there's some kind of
unethical line that's crossed

01:25:45.810 --> 01:25:49.320
when you continuously represent a client.

01:25:49.320 --> 01:25:52.650
- Yeah. He thought it was
not so much an ethical line.

01:25:52.650 --> 01:25:55.260
You have a right to
represent mafia people,

01:25:55.260 --> 01:25:56.910
but he didn't want to be house counsel.

01:25:56.910 --> 01:26:00.990
He didn't want to have
them ask him for advice,

01:26:00.990 --> 01:26:02.883
in advance of what they were doing.

01:26:04.041 --> 01:26:06.090
He was willing to represent somebody once,

01:26:06.090 --> 01:26:07.740
no matter how awful.

01:26:07.740 --> 01:26:11.220
Claus von Bulow was accused
of killing his wife.

01:26:11.220 --> 01:26:12.993
These are pretty nasty people.

01:26:14.670 --> 01:26:19.670
But he didn't want to be
house counsel to any of them.

01:26:19.710 --> 01:26:24.090
- So, you wrote a review of
Alan Dershowitz's new book

01:26:24.090 --> 01:26:25.440
on Donald Trump.

01:26:25.440 --> 01:26:26.347
The title of that book is,

01:26:26.347 --> 01:26:28.890
"Get Trump: the Threat to Civil Liberties,

01:26:28.890 --> 01:26:32.310
Due Process and Our
Constitutional Rule of Law".

01:26:32.310 --> 01:26:35.190
Can you summarize this
book and your review of it?

01:26:35.190 --> 01:26:36.023
- Yes.

01:26:36.023 --> 01:26:38.220
By the way, I co-authored it
with my research assistant,

01:26:38.220 --> 01:26:39.720
who's sitting right here.

01:26:39.720 --> 01:26:40.983
- Emily?
- Yes.

01:26:44.310 --> 01:26:48.720
I thought that the book was
another example of the fact

01:26:48.720 --> 01:26:53.710
that everybody's entitled
to a defense and that Alan's

01:26:54.660 --> 01:26:57.360
being involved with Trump
was purely professional.

01:26:57.360 --> 01:27:00.123
It was not political. It
was not philosophical.

01:27:01.110 --> 01:27:06.000
And I thought that the fact
that he was being criticized,

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:10.260
he was being shunned, because
of his connection to Trump,

01:27:10.260 --> 01:27:13.830
I found very interesting
that this is a guy

01:27:13.830 --> 01:27:15.543
who represented such,

01:27:18.393 --> 01:27:21.090
I'll call them distasteful figures,

01:27:21.090 --> 01:27:22.683
as Claus von Bulow,

01:27:24.030 --> 01:27:24.863
as

01:27:26.190 --> 01:27:27.363
Mike Tyson,

01:27:28.380 --> 01:27:31.110
as OJ Simpson,

01:27:31.110 --> 01:27:32.403
as Sheldon Siegel.

01:27:34.650 --> 01:27:39.317
And when he was considered
to be a skillful lawyer,

01:27:40.440 --> 01:27:42.003
made his reputation.

01:27:43.050 --> 01:27:46.110
And then he represents Donald
Trump, who to my knowledge,

01:27:46.110 --> 01:27:47.553
never killed anybody,

01:27:49.830 --> 01:27:52.500
and he's suddenly shunned.

01:27:52.500 --> 01:27:56.253
I thought the hypocrisy of
it, the political preening,

01:27:57.300 --> 01:28:00.813
was very distasteful to me.

01:28:02.580 --> 01:28:04.350
And it was not only
'cause he was my friend.

01:28:04.350 --> 01:28:07.100
If he wasn't my friend, I
think I'd have the same view.

01:28:08.760 --> 01:28:10.983
The "holier than thou" nonsense.

01:28:12.240 --> 01:28:13.743
The hypocrisy of it.

01:28:15.720 --> 01:28:18.210
They wouldn't talk to him
on Martha's Vineyard now.

01:28:18.210 --> 01:28:21.183
Alan and I are different.
I'm not so sensitive.

01:28:22.440 --> 01:28:25.170
Someone doesn't wanna
talk to me? No problem.

01:28:25.170 --> 01:28:26.673
No problem at all.

01:28:28.350 --> 01:28:33.350
But Alan, considering how
controversial his life has been,

01:28:33.480 --> 01:28:35.700
- He's somewhat sensitive.
- He's somewhat sensitive.

01:28:35.700 --> 01:28:37.747
And I've kept just telling Alan,

01:28:37.747 --> 01:28:39.630
"Alan, don't let it get to you."

01:28:39.630 --> 01:28:42.330
- Hey. I can relate, I
can definitely relate.

01:28:42.330 --> 01:28:44.190
Taking on some
controversial conversations.

01:28:44.190 --> 01:28:45.990
Still wear my heart on
my sleeve. It hurts.

01:28:45.990 --> 01:28:47.310
All of it hurts.
- Yep.

01:28:47.310 --> 01:28:49.260
- But maybe the pain makes you a better

01:28:50.340 --> 01:28:52.110
student of human nature.

01:28:52.110 --> 01:28:53.490
Maybe that's the case for him.

01:28:53.490 --> 01:28:57.450
Nevertheless, the book makes a complicated

01:28:57.450 --> 01:28:59.449
and I think an interesting point.

01:28:59.449 --> 01:29:02.497
He opens the book with,

01:29:02.497 --> 01:29:04.980
"Now that Donald Trump has
announced his candidacy

01:29:04.980 --> 01:29:08.700
for reelection as president,
the unremitting efforts

01:29:08.700 --> 01:29:11.940
by his political opponents
to, quote, get him,

01:29:11.940 --> 01:29:15.450
to stop him from running, at
any cost, will only increase.

01:29:15.450 --> 01:29:18.270
These efforts may pose the
most significant threat

01:29:18.270 --> 01:29:20.580
to civil liberty since McCarthyism."

01:29:20.580 --> 01:29:23.220
So, is he right?
- He's absolutely right.

01:29:23.220 --> 01:29:25.680
Because these attempted...

01:29:25.680 --> 01:29:28.440
For example, the prosecution,

01:29:28.440 --> 01:29:32.010
the one prosecution that has
been brought now, Alvin Bragg,

01:29:32.010 --> 01:29:33.990
in the Manhattan.

01:29:33.990 --> 01:29:34.900
I have looked at that,

01:29:34.900 --> 01:29:38.010
and I don't believe that
Trump has committed a crime,

01:29:38.010 --> 01:29:41.730
and yet Bragg was pressured to bring that.

01:29:41.730 --> 01:29:43.650
People in his office
were threatening to quit,

01:29:43.650 --> 01:29:45.030
if he didn't indict.

01:29:45.030 --> 01:29:47.493
Wholly improper, wholly unethical,

01:29:48.570 --> 01:29:50.640
and he's gonna lose the case.

01:29:50.640 --> 01:29:53.070
Has Trump committed crimes? Yes.

01:29:53.070 --> 01:29:54.723
Mostly, they're tax crimes.

01:29:57.093 --> 01:30:00.180
He has cheated on taxes, his whole career,

01:30:00.180 --> 01:30:01.830
as far as I could tell.

01:30:01.830 --> 01:30:06.830
He could easily be indicted
for state and federal taxes,

01:30:06.870 --> 01:30:09.540
but they're not as sexy.

01:30:09.540 --> 01:30:13.990
And I think that he's become a target

01:30:15.960 --> 01:30:20.400
by ambitious politicians,
ambitious prosecutors.

01:30:20.400 --> 01:30:24.510
He has gotten some sympathy,
which he doesn't deserve.

01:30:24.510 --> 01:30:28.260
and a lot of it is, pardon the phrase,

01:30:28.260 --> 01:30:30.180
political correctness.

01:30:30.180 --> 01:30:33.963
The better people are not
supposed to be Trumpers.

01:30:36.750 --> 01:30:38.923
I had an interesting
experience about Trump.

01:30:38.923 --> 01:30:41.400
I had two interesting experiences.

01:30:41.400 --> 01:30:44.440
The more recent one was
I was in the house of

01:30:45.960 --> 01:30:49.740
Lawrence Summers, the
former president of Harvard,

01:30:49.740 --> 01:30:52.470
who was driven out by political
correctness, by the way.

01:30:52.470 --> 01:30:54.813
He insulted women biologists.

01:30:56.820 --> 01:31:01.383
I was in his house when he was
still President of Harvard,

01:31:02.580 --> 01:31:07.580
when the Trump/Hillary
Clinton contest took place.

01:31:09.477 --> 01:31:11.973
And I was with Elsa.

01:31:13.560 --> 01:31:15.813
We were invited to Summers' house,

01:31:17.040 --> 01:31:18.093
in Brookline,

01:31:19.050 --> 01:31:23.790
and it looked like Hillary was gonna win,

01:31:23.790 --> 01:31:26.850
and the Harvard faculty members,
they were all celebrating,

01:31:26.850 --> 01:31:29.490
they were all figuring out
what their cabinet positions

01:31:29.490 --> 01:31:31.890
were gonna be, blah,
blah, blah, blah, blah.

01:31:31.890 --> 01:31:34.140
And then, at about 11:30 at night,

01:31:34.140 --> 01:31:36.000
all of a sudden, it was announced that,

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:37.950
in terms of electoral votes,

01:31:37.950 --> 01:31:41.070
Trump had just eked out of a victory.

01:31:41.070 --> 01:31:43.410
That Hillary beat him in the popular vote,

01:31:43.410 --> 01:31:48.060
but he had won the electoral college,

01:31:48.060 --> 01:31:50.973
and there was an immediate depression.

01:31:54.570 --> 01:31:56.490
- [Lex] Meaning like quiet over the room?

01:31:56.490 --> 01:31:59.763
- The room became absolutely stone-silent.

01:32:01.290 --> 01:32:05.460
And they were all, you know, disappointed.

01:32:05.460 --> 01:32:07.500
Well, that was a memorable moment.

01:32:07.500 --> 01:32:10.140
And it told me that

01:32:10.140 --> 01:32:12.423
they were a little bit too overconfident.

01:32:13.560 --> 01:32:16.330
They were savoring

01:32:17.340 --> 01:32:20.163
being part of a
presidential administration.

01:32:21.330 --> 01:32:22.923
Ambition had been thwarted.

01:32:24.120 --> 01:32:27.570
I'm not a great fan of preening ambition.

01:32:27.570 --> 01:32:30.360
I think it blinds people to realities.

01:32:30.360 --> 01:32:32.550
- [Lex] And the resulting
arrogance from such ambition.

01:32:32.550 --> 01:32:34.530
- And the arrogance, yes.

01:32:34.530 --> 01:32:37.770
It's one of the reasons I
didn't accept Jim Vorenberg's

01:32:37.770 --> 01:32:40.260
offer to be part of
the academic community.

01:32:40.260 --> 01:32:41.580
I mean, I represent professors,

01:32:41.580 --> 01:32:42.870
I had friends who were professors.

01:32:42.870 --> 01:32:45.570
I represent students, I have
friends who are students,

01:32:47.040 --> 01:32:50.460
and I have a great
regard for universities,

01:32:50.460 --> 01:32:51.873
and higher education.

01:32:53.040 --> 01:32:55.650
But I was not about to
become part of the culture.

01:32:55.650 --> 01:32:57.810
I thought that it was not good for me,

01:32:57.810 --> 01:33:01.200
and not good for the institution, either.

01:33:01.200 --> 01:33:02.940
- A culture that can breed arrogance.

01:33:02.940 --> 01:33:04.740
- Yes.
- Self importance.

01:33:04.740 --> 01:33:06.210
- [Harvey] Yep.

01:33:06.210 --> 01:33:07.890
- And I, in a sense,

01:33:07.890 --> 01:33:11.460
the election of Donald Trump
was a big F.U. to such-

01:33:11.460 --> 01:33:12.450
- Correct.

01:33:12.450 --> 01:33:14.430
Which is why I think he,

01:33:14.430 --> 01:33:18.033
why I think he managed to pull it off.

01:33:19.230 --> 01:33:20.820
- To jump topics a little bit,

01:33:20.820 --> 01:33:24.090
what do you think about
something you've written about,

01:33:24.090 --> 01:33:26.490
what do you think about the
mass surveillance programs

01:33:26.490 --> 01:33:30.090
by the NSA and also probably
by other organizations,

01:33:30.090 --> 01:33:32.373
CIA, FBI, and others?

01:33:33.630 --> 01:33:36.540
And broadly, what do you think about

01:33:36.540 --> 01:33:40.020
the importance of privacy
for the American citizen?

01:33:40.020 --> 01:33:40.853
- Okay.

01:33:40.853 --> 01:33:44.340
I believe that the FBI

01:33:44.340 --> 01:33:45.603
should be abolished.

01:33:46.950 --> 01:33:50.580
'Cause I believe that its
culture was so corrupted

01:33:50.580 --> 01:33:53.190
by its first director,

01:33:53.190 --> 01:33:55.740
John Edgar Hoover,

01:33:55.740 --> 01:33:57.183
J. Edgar Hoover,

01:33:58.110 --> 01:34:02.610
that it is impossible to reform the FBI

01:34:02.610 --> 01:34:05.403
to make its agents honest,

01:34:06.810 --> 01:34:09.720
to force them to obey the constitution.

01:34:09.720 --> 01:34:13.413
The First, Fourth and Fifth
amendments, especially.

01:34:16.020 --> 01:34:19.143
And it's a culture that cannot be changed.

01:34:20.490 --> 01:34:25.290
Hoover established the culture
and no FBI director since

01:34:25.290 --> 01:34:26.643
has been able to change it.

01:34:27.780 --> 01:34:29.910
If you go online,

01:34:29.910 --> 01:34:33.750
I did, on YouTube, a video,

01:34:33.750 --> 01:34:35.730
for the ACLU of Massachusetts.

01:34:35.730 --> 01:34:37.080
It was when I was on the board.

01:34:37.080 --> 01:34:39.060
It was probably when I was
president of the board.

01:34:39.060 --> 01:34:41.250
I was president of the
board for two years.

01:34:41.250 --> 01:34:44.370
I was on the board for 20 years.

01:34:44.370 --> 01:34:45.280
And I did

01:34:46.483 --> 01:34:50.190
a video about advising
people to never, ever,

01:34:50.190 --> 01:34:51.990
ever talk to an FBI agent,

01:34:51.990 --> 01:34:54.510
when they come knocking on your door.

01:34:54.510 --> 01:34:58.050
- Can you briefly explain the intuition

01:34:58.050 --> 01:34:59.103
why not to talk to an FBI agent?

01:34:59.103 --> 01:35:01.380
- They have a system.

01:35:01.380 --> 01:35:03.960
When they come in and interview you,

01:35:03.960 --> 01:35:06.243
two agents show up, never one.

01:35:07.320 --> 01:35:10.260
One asks the question.
The other one takes notes.

01:35:10.260 --> 01:35:12.510
The note-taking agent
takes notes and it goes

01:35:12.510 --> 01:35:17.510
back to the office and types
up a report called a Form 302,

01:35:18.060 --> 01:35:23.060
which is the official record
of what was asked and answered.

01:35:25.980 --> 01:35:29.253
So, when I have a client
interviewed by the FBI,

01:35:30.270 --> 01:35:31.143
I show up,

01:35:32.430 --> 01:35:37.430
and I always agree, almost
always agree to the interview.

01:35:40.020 --> 01:35:41.493
But I bring a tape recorder.

01:35:42.930 --> 01:35:45.090
And I say, "All right,
I'm gonna tape this."

01:35:45.090 --> 01:35:47.460
And they say, "Well, by regulation,

01:35:47.460 --> 01:35:50.060
we're not allowed to do the
interview if it's taped.

01:35:51.120 --> 01:35:55.620
The record is the 302,
the agent's taking notes."

01:35:55.620 --> 01:35:58.890
I say, "Well, I have a policy, too.

01:35:58.890 --> 01:36:01.830
My policy is to never allow
a client to be interviewed,

01:36:01.830 --> 01:36:03.123
unless it's recorded.

01:36:03.960 --> 01:36:05.580
So, it's unfortunate,

01:36:05.580 --> 01:36:07.410
but we're gonna have to end this meeting."

01:36:07.410 --> 01:36:09.243
And the agents get up and leave.

01:36:11.190 --> 01:36:15.240
And I have never seen a Form 302

01:36:15.240 --> 01:36:17.580
that I consider to be accurate.

01:36:17.580 --> 01:36:22.580
The agents write down what
they wish you had said.

01:36:23.160 --> 01:36:24.630
Rather than what you said.

01:36:24.630 --> 01:36:28.740
It is a wholly corrupt organization

01:36:28.740 --> 01:36:31.620
that has not gotten any
better since Hoover died.

01:36:31.620 --> 01:36:35.580
- [Lex] And fundamentally, the
corruption is in the culture

01:36:35.580 --> 01:36:40.580
that is resisting the
Constitution of the United States.

01:36:40.980 --> 01:36:42.600
The First and Fourth and Fifth amendments.

01:36:42.600 --> 01:36:46.157
- Correct. It's not financial corruption.

01:36:46.157 --> 01:36:49.533
It is corruption of the mission.

01:36:50.610 --> 01:36:53.430
And I think it should be abolished.

01:36:53.430 --> 01:36:56.700
And if we need a federal
investigative agency,

01:36:56.700 --> 01:37:00.943
it should be a new name, a new
culture, wholly new members,

01:37:00.943 --> 01:37:02.163
a new director.

01:37:03.510 --> 01:37:05.940
It's impossible

01:37:05.940 --> 01:37:08.310
to reform the FBI.

01:37:08.310 --> 01:37:11.220
- Can you elaborate on what
exactly is broken about the FBI?

01:37:11.220 --> 01:37:14.670
Is it the famous saying,

01:37:14.670 --> 01:37:18.180
from Stalin's KGB head,

01:37:18.180 --> 01:37:20.610
Beria, "Show me the man and
I'll show you the crime"?

01:37:20.610 --> 01:37:23.070
- Right.
- Is it that kind of process?

01:37:23.070 --> 01:37:24.270
- It's that kind of process.

01:37:24.270 --> 01:37:27.270
They decide who's guilty and
then they go about concocting

01:37:27.270 --> 01:37:31.770
a case against a person
who they want to get.

01:37:31.770 --> 01:37:35.220
- [Lex] So, the goal is
not to find the truth or-

01:37:35.220 --> 01:37:37.800
- It's to solve the case and close it,

01:37:37.800 --> 01:37:40.620
and enhance their reputations.

01:37:40.620 --> 01:37:43.890
- But to show that an
innocent man is guilty

01:37:43.890 --> 01:37:47.013
is also solving the case,
from their perspective.

01:37:47.910 --> 01:37:50.880
So, to falsely convict,

01:37:50.880 --> 01:37:53.460
or falsely imprison an innocent man

01:37:53.460 --> 01:37:55.560
is also solving the case.

01:37:55.560 --> 01:37:56.900
- Well, it closes the case,

01:37:56.900 --> 01:37:59.820
if they falsely imprison an innocent man.

01:37:59.820 --> 01:38:02.370
They're interested in closing cases.

01:38:02.370 --> 01:38:05.100
- So, that's the FBI, but broadly speaking

01:38:05.100 --> 01:38:07.200
about the surveillance aspect of this,

01:38:07.200 --> 01:38:11.010
what are your views on the right

01:38:11.010 --> 01:38:13.800
that an American citizen has to privacy?

01:38:13.800 --> 01:38:18.270
- Well, wire tapping and
electronic surveillance

01:38:18.270 --> 01:38:20.313
are very, very intrusive.

01:38:21.330 --> 01:38:25.270
And I think that the circumstance

01:38:26.610 --> 01:38:28.923
that these tools are
used should be narrowed.

01:38:30.150 --> 01:38:33.093
For example, they're used
in a lot of drug cases.

01:38:33.930 --> 01:38:36.840
Since I don't think drugs
should be illegal in any event,

01:38:36.840 --> 01:38:40.480
I certainly think that it's a
terrible violation of privacy

01:38:43.050 --> 01:38:45.423
to use wire tapping in a drug case.

01:38:46.560 --> 01:38:49.323
I could see it in cases of murder,

01:38:51.510 --> 01:38:55.443
possibly in cases of serious extortion,

01:38:56.370 --> 01:39:00.660
but on other kinds of kinds
of crimes where they wire tap,

01:39:00.660 --> 01:39:02.100
especially drug cases,

01:39:02.100 --> 01:39:04.473
I believe drugs should
all be legalized anyway,

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:06.950
I think it's...

01:39:09.420 --> 01:39:12.363
The price we pay as
society is not worth it.

01:39:13.710 --> 01:39:17.520
- On the Wikipedia page for
"Nothing to hide", you're cited.

01:39:17.520 --> 01:39:18.997
In fact, your book that you gave me today,

01:39:18.997 --> 01:39:21.420
"Three Felonies A Day", is cited.

01:39:21.420 --> 01:39:22.830
So, "nothing to hide" argument.

01:39:22.830 --> 01:39:26.673
That's an argument that if
you're a well-behaved citizen,

01:39:27.600 --> 01:39:28.680
you have nothing to hide,

01:39:28.680 --> 01:39:31.020
and therefore your
privacy can be violated.

01:39:31.020 --> 01:39:34.533
- Well, the problem is that
under the federal criminal code,

01:39:36.150 --> 01:39:38.100
particularly the federal criminal code,

01:39:40.500 --> 01:39:43.980
it is very easy to be
charged with a crime.

01:39:43.980 --> 01:39:44.813
Now, why?

01:39:46.860 --> 01:39:49.110
Under the Constitution,

01:39:49.110 --> 01:39:51.090
the Federal Government does not have

01:39:51.090 --> 01:39:54.210
plenary criminal jurisdiction.

01:39:54.210 --> 01:39:55.503
That's up to the state.

01:39:57.360 --> 01:40:00.900
How is it that the feds indict,

01:40:00.900 --> 01:40:03.213
in so many areas of American life?

01:40:04.320 --> 01:40:07.860
It's because the Supreme Court
has allowed the following

01:40:07.860 --> 01:40:12.063
absolutely insane situation to prevail.

01:40:13.920 --> 01:40:16.560
Anything can be made a federal crime,

01:40:16.560 --> 01:40:20.223
if, in the course of the
commission of the crime,

01:40:21.630 --> 01:40:26.630
the means of interstate
communication or travel are used.

01:40:28.500 --> 01:40:30.930
That means that if you commit a crime,

01:40:30.930 --> 01:40:34.110
which ordinarily would be a state crime,

01:40:34.110 --> 01:40:37.683
and you use the telephone
or you send a letter,

01:40:38.580 --> 01:40:40.323
it suddenly becomes federal.

01:40:41.430 --> 01:40:45.390
That means that the limitation
that the founding fathers

01:40:45.390 --> 01:40:48.900
who wrote the Constitution intended

01:40:48.900 --> 01:40:52.840
to keep the feds out of daily life

01:40:53.880 --> 01:40:56.820
and to give that jurisdiction to the state

01:40:56.820 --> 01:40:59.220
has been completely thwarted.

01:40:59.220 --> 01:41:03.600
'Cause I can't think of the a case

01:41:03.600 --> 01:41:06.270
where somebody doesn't use a telephone,

01:41:06.270 --> 01:41:07.780
in the course of

01:41:09.150 --> 01:41:13.173
planning, discussing something
that's arguably criminal.

01:41:14.040 --> 01:41:18.213
And so this limited authority,
the federal government,

01:41:20.550 --> 01:41:25.550
to bring charges in
criminal cases, is illusory.

01:41:26.310 --> 01:41:28.413
The feds can indict a ham sandwich.

01:41:29.430 --> 01:41:32.013
- So basically, everybody's
guilty, and if the,

01:41:34.142 --> 01:41:36.390
if the feds wanna bring you in, they can.

01:41:36.390 --> 01:41:37.560
They can find a way.
- Correct.

01:41:37.560 --> 01:41:42.560
And that allows them to terrorize
people who are dissidents.

01:41:42.960 --> 01:41:43.920
- Yeah.

01:41:43.920 --> 01:41:45.220
What is

01:41:46.110 --> 01:41:48.330
broken, what works, about the American

01:41:48.330 --> 01:41:50.765
criminal justice system,
from your perspective?

01:41:50.765 --> 01:41:52.200
- [Harvey] The jury system.

01:41:52.200 --> 01:41:53.880
- The jury system?
- Yes.

01:41:53.880 --> 01:41:57.390
- You like the jury system.
Everyday citizens representing-

01:41:57.390 --> 01:42:01.593
- 12 ordinary people have
to agree, unanimously,

01:42:03.060 --> 01:42:04.060
in order to convict.

01:42:05.550 --> 01:42:07.950
- What do you think about the
highest court in the land,

01:42:07.950 --> 01:42:08.880
the Supreme Court?

01:42:08.880 --> 01:42:11.130
What works and what is broken
about the Supreme Court,

01:42:11.130 --> 01:42:12.300
as an institution?

01:42:12.300 --> 01:42:13.980
What are its strengths and weaknesses?

01:42:13.980 --> 01:42:16.000
- Well, the Supreme Court is

01:42:17.580 --> 01:42:20.433
unfortunately fairly political.

01:42:21.510 --> 01:42:26.510
And the current Supreme Court
is overruling precedence,

01:42:27.480 --> 01:42:30.600
which, it's really improper.

01:42:30.600 --> 01:42:34.533
Precedence should not
be overruled so easily.

01:42:36.030 --> 01:42:40.800
It's about to overrule
the affirmative action.

01:42:40.800 --> 01:42:42.930
Now, I'm opposed to affirmative action.

01:42:42.930 --> 01:42:46.440
I think I made that clear
earlier in our discussion,

01:42:46.440 --> 01:42:49.080
but still, it's a precedent,

01:42:49.080 --> 01:42:53.010
and it should be given some respect.

01:42:53.010 --> 01:42:55.623
But in order to,

01:42:58.380 --> 01:43:02.080
in order to propagate a more conservative

01:43:03.570 --> 01:43:06.480
agenda, the court is treating precedent

01:43:06.480 --> 01:43:09.300
as if it doesn't have any role,

01:43:09.300 --> 01:43:11.763
and that's a huge mistake.

01:43:13.530 --> 01:43:16.530
Some of the congressmen
on the Democratic side

01:43:16.530 --> 01:43:19.020
are looking to enlarge the court,

01:43:19.020 --> 01:43:22.560
in order to basically do
what Franklin Roosevelt

01:43:22.560 --> 01:43:23.943
was not able to do.

01:43:26.070 --> 01:43:30.843
And that is, change
the court's philosophy.

01:43:31.800 --> 01:43:34.320
But I think that's very shortsighted,

01:43:34.320 --> 01:43:38.430
because this is a long game.

01:43:38.430 --> 01:43:40.920
This is a republic we have here.

01:43:40.920 --> 01:43:44.550
And anyone who tries to,

01:43:44.550 --> 01:43:47.310
for example, enlarge
the court from 9 to 12,

01:43:47.310 --> 01:43:51.900
in order to get more
liberals on the court,

01:43:51.900 --> 01:43:55.650
then some other administration
will try to enlarge it

01:43:55.650 --> 01:43:59.040
from 12 to 15, to get more
liberals on the court.

01:43:59.040 --> 01:43:59.873
You'd have

01:44:01.758 --> 01:44:06.300
a constant fiddling with a
very important institution.

01:44:06.300 --> 01:44:08.430
- So the law should
have more lasting power

01:44:08.430 --> 01:44:11.400
than the political bickering of the day.

01:44:11.400 --> 01:44:12.330
- Correct.

01:44:12.330 --> 01:44:17.330
- Let me ask you, you've
lived one heck of a life,

01:44:17.460 --> 01:44:21.450
and fought a lot of battles
and you continue to do so,

01:44:21.450 --> 01:44:23.487
with the Harvard Board of Overseers.

01:44:23.487 --> 01:44:26.883
So, first of all, thank
you for that, but uh,

01:44:28.140 --> 01:44:30.240
we're all human, we're all mortal.

01:44:30.240 --> 01:44:31.650
Do you ponder your death?

01:44:31.650 --> 01:44:33.930
Do you ponder your mortality?
Are you afraid of it?

01:44:33.930 --> 01:44:37.230
- Well, let me say this.
My father died at 48.

01:44:37.230 --> 01:44:38.670
He died 'cause he smoked.

01:44:38.670 --> 01:44:42.510
He died at 48 because he smoked
four packs of Camels a day.

01:44:42.510 --> 01:44:45.270
He got a massive heart attack at 43.

01:44:45.270 --> 01:44:48.990
He continued to smoke, despite that.

01:44:48.990 --> 01:44:52.500
He died at 48. So, I did not
expect to live this long.

01:44:52.500 --> 01:44:53.760
'Cause I thought it was genetic.

01:44:53.760 --> 01:44:55.443
It turns out it was cigarettes.

01:44:56.430 --> 01:45:00.523
So, here I am, I'm
gonna be 81 on May 10th.

01:45:00.523 --> 01:45:02.550
I was born on May 10th, 1942,

01:45:02.550 --> 01:45:05.103
which is Mother's Day, coincidentally,

01:45:06.600 --> 01:45:09.690
and I realize I'm not gonna live forever.

01:45:09.690 --> 01:45:14.690
I also take pride in the
fact that I have demonstrated

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:17.580
that a lawyer does not
have to go with a law firm,

01:45:17.580 --> 01:45:19.620
in order to manage to make it.

01:45:19.620 --> 01:45:22.980
You can make your own, write
your own, what's the word?

01:45:22.980 --> 01:45:24.093
Write your own ticket.

01:45:25.710 --> 01:45:26.583
I've done that.

01:45:28.920 --> 01:45:32.010
I agree that I've had an elite education.

01:45:32.010 --> 01:45:34.890
I went to Princeton
and Harvard Law School.

01:45:34.890 --> 01:45:36.720
But I don't think you have to necessarily

01:45:36.720 --> 01:45:40.020
go to elite institutions
in order to really make it.

01:45:40.020 --> 01:45:41.253
You need to work hard.

01:45:42.240 --> 01:45:44.370
But you shouldn't put
yourself in a place where

01:45:44.370 --> 01:45:48.210
you're not gonna feel
comfortable and what's the word?

01:45:48.210 --> 01:45:49.043
Empowered?

01:45:49.043 --> 01:45:52.390
Like I refused to take Vorenberg's

01:45:54.060 --> 01:45:57.303
invitation for tenure track
position at Harvard Law School.

01:46:02.760 --> 01:46:06.963
I'll tell you one other
story that illustrates this.

01:46:08.160 --> 01:46:09.840
I was originally pre-med.

01:46:09.840 --> 01:46:12.510
My freshman-sophomore years at Princeton,

01:46:12.510 --> 01:46:14.160
I was in the pre-med program.

01:46:14.160 --> 01:46:14.993
Why?

01:46:15.930 --> 01:46:17.380
Because my parents

01:46:18.360 --> 01:46:22.683
wanted me to marry the daughter
of our family physician.

01:46:24.180 --> 01:46:28.647
And the idea was I was
gonna go to medical school

01:46:28.647 --> 01:46:31.350
and I was gonna go into
medical practice with him

01:46:31.350 --> 01:46:33.033
in Hackensack, New Jersey.

01:46:35.070 --> 01:46:37.170
We had moved from Brooklyn at the time.

01:46:37.170 --> 01:46:39.390
Long story why we had
to move from Brooklyn.

01:46:39.390 --> 01:46:42.240
It had to do with my
father's having a problem

01:46:42.240 --> 01:46:44.890
with the Furies Union and
having his life threatened.

01:46:46.410 --> 01:46:47.807
And we moved to Maywood, New Jersey,

01:46:47.807 --> 01:46:51.513
'cause he got a job in a fur
shop in Passaic, New Jersey.

01:46:52.950 --> 01:46:55.950
And a family physician,
they had three daughters,

01:46:55.950 --> 01:46:58.380
the oldest of whom was my age.

01:46:58.380 --> 01:47:00.130
She went to Hackensack High School.

01:47:01.050 --> 01:47:03.120
I went to Pagoda High School.

01:47:03.120 --> 01:47:05.373
They're both in North Burton County.

01:47:06.990 --> 01:47:11.990
And the idea was that she
and I were gonna marry,

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:16.620
I was gonna go to medical
school, I was going to become

01:47:16.620 --> 01:47:19.110
a partner of her father,

01:47:19.110 --> 01:47:21.153
in his medical practice in Hackensack.

01:47:22.080 --> 01:47:25.210
When he retired, I was
gonna inherit the practice.

01:47:25.210 --> 01:47:28.767
This scenario was concocted
by Carolyn's mother,

01:47:28.767 --> 01:47:29.823
and my mother.

01:47:32.370 --> 01:47:35.940
In my sophomore year at Princeton,

01:47:35.940 --> 01:47:39.120
I won a fellowship to spend that summer

01:47:39.120 --> 01:47:42.090
between my sophomore and
junior year in Paris.

01:47:42.090 --> 01:47:43.473
I was fluent by then.

01:47:44.670 --> 01:47:47.100
I had taken an accelerated French course,

01:47:47.100 --> 01:47:48.723
my freshman-sophomore year.

01:47:50.130 --> 01:47:52.473
And I went to Paris.

01:47:53.708 --> 01:47:55.708
It was my first time out of the country.

01:47:59.430 --> 01:48:02.733
I spent the entire summer working,

01:48:03.900 --> 01:48:06.600
supporting myself there,
first to pay the airfare,

01:48:06.600 --> 01:48:08.890
and I earned money

01:48:09.930 --> 01:48:11.133
for room and board.

01:48:13.124 --> 01:48:15.870
And I thought about my life
and I decided, number one,

01:48:15.870 --> 01:48:19.260
I didn't want to be a physician,
I wanted to be a lawyer.

01:48:19.260 --> 01:48:22.173
Number two, I didn't
want to marry Carolyn.

01:48:23.580 --> 01:48:27.633
And I came back, I changed
from pre-med to pre-law.

01:48:28.680 --> 01:48:30.930
I broke up with Carolyn,

01:48:30.930 --> 01:48:33.600
who was, by that time,
at school at Douglas,

01:48:33.600 --> 01:48:34.980
right down the road from Princeton.

01:48:34.980 --> 01:48:36.123
She had followed me.

01:48:38.010 --> 01:48:39.453
Or I had followed her.

01:48:42.870 --> 01:48:45.903
My life suddenly took a
wholly different turn.

01:48:47.040 --> 01:48:50.100
So, that summer, in Paris,

01:48:50.100 --> 01:48:50.933
Paris

01:48:51.780 --> 01:48:55.773
had a outsized effect of my life.

01:48:56.700 --> 01:49:01.230
Every year, the Bravo
Theater shows "Casablanca",

01:49:01.230 --> 01:49:04.350
where Bogart has this great line.

01:49:04.350 --> 01:49:07.317
He says, "We'll always have Paris."

01:49:08.190 --> 01:49:11.340
And I think to myself, I
always used to say Elsa,

01:49:11.340 --> 01:49:14.760
we used to see "Casablanca"
every Valentine's Day,

01:49:14.760 --> 01:49:17.250
'cause it was such an
important movie to me,

01:49:17.250 --> 01:49:21.660
because Paris was
transformative in my life,

01:49:21.660 --> 01:49:23.970
and we went to Paris, every year.

01:49:23.970 --> 01:49:27.000
During my vacation, we went to Paris.

01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:31.440
That was where she took
some great pictures of Isaac

01:49:31.440 --> 01:49:32.670
where he was this high and this high,

01:49:32.670 --> 01:49:34.743
and they were hanging up in the house.

01:49:36.060 --> 01:49:38.360
And so I always...

01:49:40.080 --> 01:49:42.210
And even after Elsa's death,

01:49:42.210 --> 01:49:44.643
I've seen "Casablanca" twice now.

01:49:45.540 --> 01:49:47.493
She died in 2020.

01:49:48.810 --> 01:49:52.857
And I always think,
"We'll always have Paris."

01:49:53.767 --> 01:49:55.816
- "We'll always have Paris."

01:49:55.816 --> 01:49:57.750
(Lex breathes deeply)

01:49:57.750 --> 01:50:00.060
Well, Harvey,

01:50:00.060 --> 01:50:03.633
like I said, I hope you're
very successful in your,

01:50:04.680 --> 01:50:07.140
in your run for the
Harvard Board of Overseers.

01:50:07.140 --> 01:50:09.330
I think what you stand for,

01:50:09.330 --> 01:50:11.620
in the realm of freedom of speech is

01:50:12.810 --> 01:50:15.660
I think the thing that
makes these universities

01:50:15.660 --> 01:50:18.060
great institutions in American culture,

01:50:18.060 --> 01:50:22.140
and I'll do everything I
can to help you succeed

01:50:22.140 --> 01:50:25.170
and I just am really grateful
for all the work you've done

01:50:25.170 --> 01:50:26.880
and I'm grateful that you
would talk with me today.

01:50:26.880 --> 01:50:28.863
This was amazing. Thank you.

01:50:29.790 --> 01:50:31.320
Thanks for listening to this conversation

01:50:31.320 --> 01:50:33.360
with Harvey Silverglate.

01:50:33.360 --> 01:50:35.670

01:50:35.670 --> 01:50:37.080
in the description.

01:50:37.080 --> 01:50:41.287
And now, let me leave you some
words from Harry S. Truman.

01:50:41.287 --> 01:50:43.020
"Once a government is committed

01:50:43.020 --> 01:50:46.200
to the principle of silencing
the voice of the opposition,

01:50:46.200 --> 01:50:48.180
it has only one way to go,

01:50:48.180 --> 01:50:49.500
and that is down the path

01:50:49.500 --> 01:50:52.110
of increasingly repressive measures,

01:50:52.110 --> 01:50:55.590
until it becomes a source of
terror to all its citizens,

01:50:55.590 --> 01:50:59.247
and creates a country where
everyone lives in fear."

01:51:00.180 --> 01:51:03.393
Thank you for listening and
I hope to see you next time.
