ahmad-alismail: Explain the project structure for me

The project seems to follow a standard Python project structure, with the main application logic located in a file named `main.py` and the `run.py` file being used to start the server and open the browser.



ahmad-alismail: What is standard Python project structure

GitHub Copilot: The standard Python project structure is a convention for organizing Python code in a way that is easy to understand and maintain. The basic structure includes a top-level directory for the project, with subdirectories for source code, tests, documentation, and other resources. Here is an example of a standard Python project structure:

```
project/
├── README.md
├── requirements.txt
├── setup.py
├── src/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── module1.py
│   └── module2.py
├── tests/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── test_module1.py
│   └── test_module2.py
├── docs/
│   ├── conf.py
│   ├── index.rst
│   └── ...
└── data/
    ├── input/
    └── output/
```

In this structure, the `src` directory contains the main source code for the project, while the `tests` directory contains unit tests for the code. The `docs` directory contains documentation for the project, and the `data` directory contains input and output data for the project. The `README.md` file provides an overview of the project, while `requirements.txt` lists the dependencies required to run the project. The `setup.py` file is used to package the project for distribution.
