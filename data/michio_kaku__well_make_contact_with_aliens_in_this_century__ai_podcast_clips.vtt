00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.280
You've mentioned that we just might make contact with aliens, or at least hear from

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:08.920
them within this century.

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:12.280
Can you elaborate on your intuition behind that optimism?

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:15.000
Well, this is pure speculation, of course.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Of course.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.960
But given the fact that we've already identified 4,000 exoplanets orbiting other stars, and

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:28.440
we have a census of the Milky Way galaxy for the first time, we know that on average, every

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:34.580
single star, on average, has a planet going around it, and about one-fifth or so of them

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:38.400
have Earth-sized planets going around them.

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.080
So just do the math.

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:45.860
We're talking about, out of 100 billion stars in the Milky Way galaxy, we're talking about

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:50.200
billions of potential Earth-sized planets.

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:56.420
And to believe that we're the only one is, I think, rather ridiculous, given the odds.

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.060
But how many galaxies are there?

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:05.040
Within sight of the Hubble Space Telescope, there are about 100 billion galaxies.

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.840
So do the math.

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.500
How many stars are there in the visible universe?

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:17.400
A hundred billion galaxies times a hundred billion stars per galaxy, we're talking about

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.980
a number beyond human imagination.

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:25.400
And to believe that we're the only ones, I think, is rather ridiculous.

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:32.600
So you've talked about different types of, type 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 even, of the Kardashev

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:37.800
scale of the different kinds of civilizations.

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:42.320
What do you think it takes, if it is indeed a ridiculous notion that we're alone in the

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:48.080
universe, what do you think it takes to reach out, first to reach out through communication

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:49.080
and connect?

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:55.840
Well first of all, we have to understand the level of sophistication of an alien life form,

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.400
if we make contact with them.

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.800
I think in this century, we'll probably pick up signals.

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:06.760
Signals from an extraterrestrial civilization will pick up their I Love Lucy and their Leave

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:12.920
It to Beaver, just ordinary day-to-day transmissions that they emit.

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:18.000
And the first thing we want to do is to A, decipher their language, of course, but B,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.080
figure out at what level they are advanced on the Kardashev scale.

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.720
I'm a physicist.

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:30.880
We rank things by two parameters, energy and information.

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:36.000
That's how we rank black holes, that's how we rank stars, that's how we rank civilizations

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.760
in outer space.

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:44.640
So a type 1 civilization is capable of harnessing planetary power.

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:50.640
They control the weather, for example, earthquakes, volcanoes, they can modify the course of geological

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.640
events, sort of like Flash Gordon or Buck Rogers.

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:59.360
Type 2 would be stellar.

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.740
They play with stars, entire stars.

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:07.640
They use the entire energy output of a star, sort of like Star Trek.

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:13.840
The Federation of Planets have colonized the nearby stars, so a type 2 would be somewhat

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.240
similar to Star Trek.

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:21.160
Type 3 would be galactic, they roam the galactic space lanes.

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:26.960
And type 3 would be like Star Wars, a galactic civilization.

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:31.480
Then one day I was giving this talk in London, at the planetarium there, and the little boy

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:38.120
comes up to me and he says, Professor, you're wrong, you're wrong, there's type 4.

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:45.880
And I told him, look kid, there are planets, stars, and galaxies, that's it, folks.

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:52.920
And he kept persisting and saying, no, there's type 4, the power of the continuum.

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:57.800
And I thought about it for a moment, and I said to myself, is there an extra galactic

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:01.600
source of energy, the continuum of Star Trek?

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:07.120
And the answer is yes, there could be a type 4, and that's dark energy.

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:14.760
We now know that 73% of the energy of the universe is dark energy.

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:21.760
Dark matter represents maybe 23% or so, and we only represent 4%, we're the oddballs.

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:26.800
And so you begin to realize that yeah, there could be type 4, maybe even type 5.

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:33.200
So type 4, you're saying, being able to harness sort of like dark energy, something that permeates

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:34.280
the entire universe.

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:39.360
So being able to plug into the entire universe as a source of energy.

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:40.360
That's right.

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:43.000
And dark energy is the energy of the Big Bang.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.800
It's why the galaxies are being pushed apart, it's the energy of nothing.

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:54.100
The more nothing you have, the more dark energy that's repulsive, and so the acceleration

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:59.800
of the universe is accelerating because the more you have, the more you can have.

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.900
And that of course is by definition an exponential curve.

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:07.100
It's called the de Sitter expansion, and that's the current state of the universe.
