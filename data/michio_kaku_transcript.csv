00:40.200," That, to me, is where artificial intelligence is today, just outside of our understanding, a place we have to reach for if we're to uncover the mysteries of the human mind and build human level and superhuman level AI systems that transform our world for the better.",False,,['today/DATE'],,,,,,,,,['today'],,

01:14.680, You've mentioned that we just might make contact with aliens or at least hear from them within this century.,False,,['century/DATE'],,,,,,,,,['century'],,
01:21.740," Can you elaborate on your intuition behind that optimism? Well, this is pure speculation, of course.",False,,,,,,,,,,,,,
01:28.120, Of course.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,
01:28.960," Given the fact that we've already identified 4,000 exoplanets orbiting other stars, and we have a census of the Milky Way galaxy for the first time, we know that on average, every single star, on average, has a planet going around it, and about one fifth or so of them have Earth sized planets going around them.",False,,"['4,000/CARDINAL', 'Milky_Way/LOC', 'first/ORDINAL', 'about_one_fifth/CARDINAL', 'Earth/LOC']",,,,"['Milky_Way', 'Earth']",,,,,,,

01:52.960," We're talking about out of 100 billion stars in the Milky Way galaxy, we're talking about billions of potential Earth sized planets.",False,,"['100_billion/CARDINAL', 'Milky_Way/LOC', 'billion/CARDINAL', 'Earth/LOC']",,,,"['Milky_Way', 'Earth']",,,,,,,
02:02.880," And to believe that we're the only one is, I think, rather ridiculous, given the odds.",False,,,,,,,,,,,,,
02:09.160," And how many galaxies are there? Within sight of the Hubble Space Telescope, there are about 100 billion galaxies.",False,,"['Hubble_Space_Telescope/FAC', 'about_100_billion/CARDINAL']",,,,,,,,,,,
02:17.880, So do the math.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,

02:29.360, We're talking about a number beyond human imagination.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,
02:33.720," And to believe that we're the only ones, I think, is rather ridiculous.",False,,,,,,,,,,,,,
02:38.200," So you've talked about different types of, type zero, one, two, three, four, and five, even, of the Kardashev scale of the different kind of civilizations.",False,,"['zero/CARDINAL', 'one/CARDINAL', 'two/CARDINAL', 'three/CARDINAL', 'four/CARDINAL', 'five/CARDINAL', 'Kardashev/PERSON']",['Kardashev'],,,,,,,,,,
02:50.440," What do you think it takes, if it is indeed a ridiculous notion that we're alone in the universe, what do you think it takes to reach out? First, to reach out through communication and connect.",False,,['first/ORDINAL'],,,,,,,,,,,
03:02.660," Well, first of all, we have to understand the level of sophistication of an alien life form if we make contact with them.",False,,['first/ORDINAL'],,,,,,,,,,,
03:10.520," I think in this century, we'll probably pick up signals, signals from an extraterrestrial civilization.",False,,['century/DATE'],,,,,,,,,['century'],,

03:21.280, Just ordinary day to day transmissions that they emit.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,

03:37.080, I'm a physicist.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,
03:38.560," We rank things by two parameters, energy and information.",False,,['two/CARDINAL'],,,,,,,,,,,
03:43.640, That's how we rank black holes.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,
03:45.600, That's how we rank stars.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,
03:47.320, That's how we rank civilizations in outer space.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,
03:50.600, So a type one civilization is capable of harnessing planetary power.,False,,['one/CARDINAL'],,,,,,,,,,,
03:57.540," They control the weather, for example, earthquakes, volcanoes.",False,,,,,,,,,,,,,
04:01.280," They can modify the course of geological events, sort of like Flash Gordon or Buck Rogers.",False,,"['Flash_Gordon/PERSON', 'Buck_Rogers/PERSON']","['Flash_Gordon', 'Buck_Rogers']",,,,,,,,,,
04:08.400, Type two would be stellar.,False,,['two/CARDINAL'],,,,,,,,,,,
04:12.240," They play with stars, entire stars.",False,,,,,,,,,,,,,
04:15.620," They use the entire energy output of a star, sort of like Star Trek.",False,,['Star_Trek/WORK_OF_ART'],,,,,,,['Star_Trek'],,,,
04:20.560, The Federation of Planets have colonized the nearby stars.,False,,['Federation_of_Planets/ORG'],,['Federation_of_Planets'],,,,,,,,,
04:24.640, So a type two would be somewhat similar to Star Trek.,False,,"['two/CARDINAL', 'Star_Trek/WORK_OF_ART']",,,,,,,['Star_Trek'],,,,
04:29.080, Type three would be galactic.,False,,['three/CARDINAL'],,,,,,,,,,,
04:30.660, They roam the galactic space lanes.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,
04:33.840," And type three would be like Star Wars, a galactic civilization.",False,,"['three/CARDINAL', 'Star_Wars/WORK_OF_ART']",,,,,,,['Star_Wars'],,,,
04:39.880," Now, one day I was giving this talk in London at the planetarium there, and the little boy comes up to me and he says, professor, you're wrong.",False,,"['one_day/DATE', 'London/GPE']",,,['London'],,,,,,['one_day'],,
04:48.760," You're wrong, there's type four.",False,,['four/CARDINAL'],,,,,,,,,,,
04:51.000," And I told him, look, kid, there are planets, stars, and galaxies.",False,,,,,,,,,,,,,
04:57.000," That's it, folks.",False,,,,,,,,,,,,,
04:58.720," And he kept persisting and saying, no, there's type four, the power of the continuum.",False,,['four/CARDINAL'],,,,,,,,,,,
05:05.800, And I thought about it for a moment.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,
05:07.560," And I said to myself, is there an extra galactic source of energy, the continuum of Star Trek? And the answer is yes, there could be a type four.",False,,"['Star_Trek/WORK_OF_ART', 'four/CARDINAL']",,,,,,,['Star_Trek'],,,,
05:18.080, And that's dark energy.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,
05:20.040, We now know that 73% of the energy of the universe is dark energy.,False,,['73_%/PERCENT'],,,,,,,,,,,
05:27.560," Dark matter represents maybe 23% or so, and we only represent 4%.",False,,"['23_%/PERCENT', '4_%/PERCENT']",,,,,,,,,,,
05:33.040, We're the oddballs.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,
05:34.640," And so you begin to realize that, yeah, there could be type four, maybe even type five.",False,,"['four/CARDINAL', 'five/CARDINAL']",,,,,,,,,,,
05:39.760," So type four, you're saying being able to harness sort of like dark energy, something that permeates the entire universe.",False,,['four/CARDINAL'],,,,,,,,,,,
05:47.120, So be able to plug into the entire universe as a source of energy.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,
05:52.080, That's right.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,
05:52.920, And dark energy is the energy of the Big Bang.,False,,['Big_Bang/EVENT'],,,,,,['Big_Bang'],,,,,
05:55.680, It's why the galaxies are being pushed apart.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,
05:58.920, It's the energy of nothing.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,
06:00.740," The more nothing you have, the more dark energy that's repulsive.",False,,,,,,,,,,,,,
06:05.400," And so the acceleration of the universe is accelerating because the more you have, the more you can have.",False,,,,,,,,,,,,,
06:12.560," And that, of course, is by definition an exponential curve.",False,,,,,,,,,,,,,
06:15.780," It's called a de Sitter expansion, and that's the current state of the universe.",False,,,,,,,,,,,,,
06:20.480," And then type five, would that be able to seek energy sources somehow outside of our universe? And how crazy is that idea? Yeah, type five will be the multiverse.",False,,"['five/CARDINAL', 'five/CARDINAL']",,,,,,,,,,,
06:35.400," Multiverse, okay.",False,,,,,,,,,,,,,
06:36.280," I'm a quantum physicist, and we quantum physicists don't believe that the Big Bang happened once.",False,,['Big_Bang/EVENT'],,,,,,['Big_Bang'],,,,,
06:42.120, That would violate the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.,False,,['Heisenberg/PERSON'],['Heisenberg'],,,,,,,,,,
06:45.120, And that means that there could be multiple bangs happening all the time.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,
06:49.360," Even as we speak today, universes are being created, and that fits the data.",False,,['today/DATE'],,,,,,,,,['today'],,
06:56.180, The inflationary universe is a quantum theory.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,
06:59.960, So there's a certain finite probability that universes are being created all the time.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,
07:05.120," And for me, this is actually rather aesthetically pleasing because I was raised as a Presbyterian, but my parents were Buddhists.",False,,"['Presbyterian/NORP', 'Buddhists/NORP']",,,,,,,,,,,
07:15.920, And there's two diametrically opposed ideas about the universe.,False,,['two/CARDINAL'],,,,,,,,,,,
07:21.080," In Buddhism, there's only nirvana.",False,,['Buddhism/ORG'],,['Buddhism'],,,,,,,,,
07:23.240," There's no beginning, there's no end, there's only timelessness.",False,,,,,,,,,,,,,
07:26.940," But in Christianity, there is the instant when God said, let there be light.",False,,['Christianity/ORG'],,['Christianity'],,,,,,,,,
07:32.760," In other words, an instant of creation.",False,,,,,,,,,,,,,
07:35.320," So I've had these two mutually exclusive ideas in my head, and I now realize that it's possible to meld them into a single theory.",False,,['two/CARDINAL'],,,,,,,,,,,
07:45.120," Either the universe had a beginning or it didn't, right? Wrong.",False,,,,,,,,,,,,,
07:49.880," You see, our universe had a beginning.",False,,,,,,,,,,,,,
07:53.160," Our universe had an instant where somebody might have said, let there be light.",False,,,,,,,,,,,,,
07:57.860, But there are other bubble universes out there in a bubble bath of universes.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,
08:02.720, And that means that these universes are expanding into a dimension beyond our three dimensional comprehension.,False,,['three/CARDINAL'],,,,,,,,,,,
08:11.240," In other words, hyperspace.",False,,,,,,,,,,,,,
08:13.080," In other words, 11 dimensional hyperspace.",False,,['11/CARDINAL'],,,,,,,,,,,
08:16.360, So nirvana would be this timeless 11 dimensional hyperspace where big bangs are happening all the time.,False,,['11/CARDINAL'],,,,,,,,,,,
08:24.860, So we can now combine two mutually exclusive theories of creation.,False,,['two/CARDINAL'],,,,,,,,,,,
08:30.920," And Stephen Hawking, for example, even in his last book, even said that this is an argument against the existence of God.",True,,['Stephen_Hawking/PERSON'],['Stephen_Hawking'],,,,,,,,,,
08:39.320, He said there is no God because there was not enough time for God to create the universe because the big bang happened in an instant of time.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,
08:47.800," Therefore, there was no time available for him to create the universe.",False,,,,,,,,,,,,,
08:52.360," But you see, the multiverse idea means that there was a time before time.",False,,,,,,,,,,,,,
08:58.040," And there are multiple times, each bubble has its own time.",False,,,,,,,,,,,,,
09:01.920, And so it means that there could actually be a universe before the beginning of our universe.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,
09:09.640," So if you think of a bubble bath, when two bubbles collide, or when two bubbles fission to create a baby bubble, that's called the big bang.",False,,"['two/CARDINAL', 'two/CARDINAL']",,,,,,,,,,,
09:18.800, So the big bang is nothing but the collision of universes or the budding of universes.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,
09:23.720, That's such a beautiful picture of our incredibly mysterious existence.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,
09:28.000," So is that humbling to you? Exciting, the idea of multiverses? I don't even know how to even begin to wrap my mind around it.",False,,,,,,,,,,,,,
09:37.640, It's exciting for me because what I do for a living is string theory.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,
09:41.680, That's my day job.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,
09:43.040, I get paid by the city of New York to work on string theory.,False,,['New_York/GPE'],,,['New_York'],,,,,,,,
09:46.840," And you see, string theory is a multiverse theory.",False,,,,,,,,,,,,,
09:50.520," So people say, first of all, what is string theory? String theory simply says that all the particles we see in nature, the electron, the proton, the quarks, what have you, are nothing but vibrations on a musical string, on a tiny, tiny little string.",False,,['first/ORDINAL'],,,,,,,,,,,
10:05.920," You know, G. Robert Oppenheimer, the creator of the atomic bomb, was so frustrated in the 1950s with all these subatomic particles being created in our atom smashers that he announced, he announced one day that the Nobel Prize in physics should go to the physicist who does not discover a new particle that year.",False,,"['G._Robert_Oppenheimer/PERSON', '1950s/DATE', 'one_day/DATE', 'Nobel_Prize/WORK_OF_ART', 'year/DATE']",['G._Robert_Oppenheimer'],,,,,,['Nobel_Prize'],,"['1950s', 'one_day', 'year']",,
10:28.280," Well, today we think they're nothing but musical notes on these tiny little vibrating strings.",False,,['today/DATE'],,,,,,,,,['today'],,
10:32.960, So what is physics? Physics is the harmonies you can write on vibrating strings.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10:38.600, What is chemistry? Chemistry is the melodies you can play on these strings.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10:44.840, What is the universe? The universe is a symphony of strings.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10:50.280," And then what is the mind of God that Albert Einstein so eloquently wrote about for the last 30 years of his life? The mind of God would be cosmic music, resonating through 11 dimensional hyperspace.",False,,"['Albert_Einstein/PERSON', 'last_30_year/DATE', '11/CARDINAL']",['Albert_Einstein'],,,,,,,,['last_30_year'],,
11:06.160, So beautifully put.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11:07.280," What do you think is the mind of Einstein's God? Do you think there's a why that we could untangle from this universe of strings? Why are we here? What is the meaning of it all? Well, Steven Weinberg, winner of the Nobel Prize, once said that the more we learn about the universe, the more we learn that it's pointless.",False,,"['Einstein/PERSON', 'Steven_Weinberg/PERSON', 'Nobel_Prize/WORK_OF_ART']","['Einstein', 'Steven_Weinberg']",,,,,,['Nobel_Prize'],,,,
11:32.240," Well, I don't know.",False,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11:35.600, I don't profess to understand the great secrets of the universe.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11:39.320," However, let me say two things about what the giants of physics have said about this question.",False,,['two/CARDINAL'],,,,,,,,,,,
11:45.320, Einstein believed in two types of God.,False,,"['Einstein/PERSON', 'two/CARDINAL']",['Einstein'],,,,,,,,,,
11:49.320," One was the God of the Bible, the personal God, the God that answers prayers, walks on waters, performs miracles, smites the Philistines.",False,,"['one/CARDINAL', 'Bible/WORK_OF_ART', 'Philistines/NORP']",,,,,,,['Bible'],,,,
12:00.040, That's the personal God that he didn't believe in.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12:02.640," He believed in the God of Spinoza, the God of order, simplicity, harmony, beauty.",False,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12:10.040, The universe could have been ugly.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12:12.840," The universe could have been messy, random, but it's gorgeous.",False,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12:17.360," You realize that on a single sheet of paper, we can write down all the known laws of the universe.",False,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12:23.120," It's amazing, on one sheet of paper, Einstein's equation is one inch long, string theory is a lot longer, and so it's a standard model, but you could put all these equations on one sheet of paper.",False,,"['one/CARDINAL', 'Einstein/PERSON', 'one_inch/QUANTITY', 'one/CARDINAL']",['Einstein'],,,,,,,,,,
12:36.880, It didn't have to be that way.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12:38.640, It could have been messy.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12:40.240," And so, Einstein thought of himself as a young boy entering this huge library for the first time, being overwhelmed by the simplicity, elegance, and beauty of this library, but all he could do was read the first page of the first volume.",False,,"['Einstein/PERSON', 'first/ORDINAL', 'first/ORDINAL', 'first/ORDINAL']",['Einstein'],,,,,,,,,,
12:58.320," Well, that library is the universe, with all sorts of mysterious, magical things that we have yet to find.",False,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13:05.280, And then Galileo was asked about this.,False,,['Galileo/PERSON'],['Galileo'],,,,,,,,,,
13:07.920," Galileo said that the purpose of science, the purpose of science is to determine how the heavens go.",False,,['Galileo/PERSON'],['Galileo'],,,,,,,,,,
13:17.680, The purpose of religion is to determine how to go to heaven.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13:22.400," So in other words, science is about natural law, and religion is about ethics, how to be a good person, how to go to heaven.",False,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13:32.320," As long as we keep these two things apart, we're in great shape.",False,,['two/CARDINAL'],,,,,,,,,,,
13:36.960," The problem occurs when people from the natural sciences begin to pontificate about ethics, and people from religion begin to pontificate about natural law.",False,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13:47.880, That's where we get into big trouble.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13:50.800," You think they're fundamentally distinct, morality and ethics and our idea of what is right and what is wrong.",False,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13:59.360, That's something that's outside the reach of string theory and physics.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,
14:03.960, That's right.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,
14:04.800," If you talk to a squirrel about what is right and what is wrong, there's no reference frame for a squirrel, and realize that aliens from outer space, if they ever come visit us, they'll try to talk to us like we talk to squirrels in the forest, but eventually we get bored talking to the squirrels because they don't talk back to us.",False,,,,,,,,,,,,,
14:28.040, Same thing with aliens from outer space.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,
14:30.000," They come down to earth, they'll be curious about us to a degree, but after a while they just get bored because we have nothing to offer them.",False,,,,,,,,,,,,,
14:37.920," So our sense of right and wrong, what does that mean compared to a squirrel's sense of right and wrong? Now we of course do have an ethics that keeps civilizations in line, enriches our life and makes civilization possible.",False,,,,,,,,,,,,,
14:56.480," And I think that's a good thing, but it's not mandated by a law of physics.",False,,,,,,,,,,,,,
15:01.560," So if aliens do, alien species were to make contact, forgive me for staying on aliens for a bit longer.",False,,,,,,,,,,,,,
15:10.920," Do you think they're more likely to be friendly, to befriend us or to destroy us? Well, I think for the most part, they'll pretty much ignore us.",False,,,,,,,,,,,,,
15:22.880," If you're a deer in the forest, who do you fear the most? Do you fear the hunter with his gigantic 16 gauge shotgun? Or do you fear the guy with a briefcase and glasses? Well, the guy with the briefcase could be a developer about to basically flatten the entire forest, destroying your livelihood.",False,,['16_gauge/QUANTITY'],,,,,,,,,,,
15:44.200," So instinctively you may be afraid of the hunter, but actually the problem with deers in the forest is that they should fear developers because developers look at deer as simply getting in the way.",False,,,,,,,,,,,,,
15:59.440," I mean, in War of the Worlds by H.G. Wells, the aliens did not hate us.",False,,"['War_of_the_Worlds/WORK_OF_ART', 'H.G._Wells/PERSON']",['H.G._Wells'],,,,,,['War_of_the_Worlds'],,,,
16:04.760," If you read the book, the aliens did not have evil intentions toward homo sapiens.",True,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16:11.360," No, we were in the way.",False,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16:13.560, So I think we have to realize that alien civilizations may view us quite differently than in science fiction novels.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16:21.080," However, I personally believe, and I cannot prove any of this, I personally believe that they're probably gonna be peaceful because there's nothing that they want from our world.",False,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16:31.720," I mean, what are they gonna take us? What are they gonna take us for, gold? No, gold is a useless metal for the most part.",False,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16:39.360," It's silver, I mean, it's gold in color, but that only affects homo sapiens.",False,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16:45.640, Squirrels don't care about gold.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16:47.760, And so gold is a rather useless element.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16:50.560," Rare earths maybe, platinum based elements, rare earths for the electronics, yeah, maybe.",False,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16:55.720," But other than that, we have nothing to offer them.",False,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16:59.280," I mean, think about it for a moment.",False,,,,,,,,,,,,,

17:12.320," I mean, when I write down an equation in string theory, I would hope that on the other side of the galaxy, there's an alien writing down that very same equation in different notation, but that alien on the other side of the galaxy, Shakespeare, poetry, Hemingway, it would mean nothing to him or her or it.",False,,"['Shakespeare/PERSON', 'Hemingway/PERSON']","['Shakespeare', 'Hemingway']",,,,,,,,,,
17:33.960," When you think about entities that's out there, extraterrestrial, do you think they would naturally look something that even is recognizable to us as life?

17:56.160," One is our eyesight, stereo eyesight.",False,,['one/CARDINAL'],,,,,,,,,,,
17:59.320," We have the eyes of a hunter, stereo vision so we lock in on targets.",False,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18:04.240," And who is smarter, predator or prey? Predators are smarter than prey.",False,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18:11.560," They have their eyes at the front of their face, like lions, tigers, while rabbits have eyes to the side of their face.",False,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18:18.800, Why is that? Hunters have to zero in on the target.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18:22.720, They have to know how to ambush.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18:24.560," They have to know how to hide, camouflage, sneak up, stealth, deceit.",False,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18:30.160, That takes a lot of intelligence.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18:31.960," Rabbits, all they have to do is run.",False,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18:35.200," So that's the first criterion, stereo eyesight of some sort.",False,,['first/ORDINAL'],,,,,,,,,,,
18:39.880, Second is the thumb.,False,,['second/ORDINAL'],,,,,,,,,,,
18:42.760, The opposable thumb of some sort could be a claw or a tentacle.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,

55:53.960," Why do we have meltdowns? We have meltdowns because in the fusion reactors, every time you split the uranium atom, you get nuclear waste.",False,,,,,,,,,,,,,
56:00.760, Tons of it.,False,,['ton/CARDINAL'],,,,,,,,,,,
56:01.720, 30 tons of nuclear waste per reactor per year.,False,,['30_ton/QUANTITY'],,,,,,,,,,,

56:13.200," But you see, the waste product of a fusion reactor is helium gas.",False,,,,,,,,,,,,,
56:17.480, Helium gas is actually commercially valuable.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,
56:19.880, You can make money selling helium gas.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,
56:22.320," And so the waste product of a fusion reactor is helium, not nuclear waste that we find in a commercial fission plant.",False,,,,,,,,,,,,,
56:30.720," And that controlling, mastering and controlling fusion allows us to, converts us into a type one, I guess, civilization, right? Yeah, probably the backbone of a type one civilization will be fusion power.",False,,"['one/CARDINAL', 'one/CARDINAL']",,,,,,,,,,,
56:45.720," We, by the way, are type zero.",False,,['zero/CARDINAL'],,,,,,,,,,,

56:49.600," We get our energy from dead plants, for God's sake, oil and coal.",False,,,,,,,,,,,,,
56:53.560, But we are about 100 years from being type one.,False,,"['about_100_year/DATE', 'one/CARDINAL']",,,,,,,,,['about_100_year'],,
56:56.320, Get a calculator.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,
56:57.680," In fact, Carl Sagan calculated that we are about 0.7, fairly close to a 1.0.",False,,"['Carl_Sagan/PERSON', 'about_0.7/CARDINAL', '1.0/CARDINAL']",['Carl_Sagan'],,,,,,,,,,
57:05.640," For example, what is the internet? The internet is the beginning of the first type one technology to enter into our century.",False,,"['first/ORDINAL', 'one/CARDINAL', 'our_century/DATE']",,,,,,,,,['our_century'],,
57:14.080, The first planetary technology is the internet.,False,,['first/ORDINAL'],,,,,,,,,,,

57:26.880," And what about the culture? We're seeing a type one sports, soccer, the Olympics, a type one music, youth culture, rock and roll, rap music, type one fashion, Gucci, Chanel, a type one economy, the European Union, NAFTA, what have you.",False,,"['one/CARDINAL', 'Olympics/EVENT', 'one/CARDINAL', 'one/CARDINAL', 'Gucci/ORG', 'Chanel/ORG', 'one/CARDINAL', 'European_Union/ORG', 'NAFTA/ORG']",,"['Gucci', 'Chanel', 'European_Union', 'NAFTA']",,,,['Olympics'],,,,,
57:45.600, So we're beginning to see the beginnings of a type one culture in a type one civilization.,False,,"['one/CARDINAL', 'one/CARDINAL']",,,,,,,,,,,
57:52.200," And inevitably, it will spread beyond this planet.",False,,,,,,,,,,,,,
57:56.000, So you talked about sending at 20% the speed of light on a chip into Alpha Centauri.,False,,"['20_%/PERCENT', 'Alpha_Centauri/LOC']",,,,['Alpha_Centauri'],,,,,,,
58:04.800," But in a slightly nearer term, what do you think about the idea when we still have to send our biological bodies the colonization of planets, colonization of Mars? Do you see us becoming a two planet species ever or anytime soon? Well, just remember the dinosaurs did not have a space program.",False,,"['Mars/LOC', 'two/CARDINAL']",,,,['Mars'],,,,,,,
58:28.760, And that's why they're not here today.,False,,['today/DATE'],,,,,,,,,['today'],,
58:30.440, How come there are no dinosaurs in this room today? Because they didn't have a space program.,False,,['today/DATE'],,,,,,,,,['today'],,
58:35.920," We do have a space program, which means that we have an insurance policy.",False,,,,,,,,,,,,,
58:40.760," Now, I don't think we should bankrupt the Earth or deplete the Earth to go to Mars.",False,,"['Earth/LOC', 'Earth/LOC', 'Mars/LOC']",,,,"['Earth', 'Earth', 'Mars']",,,,,,,
58:44.840, That's too expensive and not practical.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,
58:47.360," But we need a settlement, a settlement on Mars in case something bad happens to the planet Earth.",False,,"['Mars/LOC', 'Earth/LOC']",,,,"['Mars', 'Earth']",,,,,,,
58:53.640, And that means we have to terraform Mars.,False,,['Mars/LOC'],,,,['Mars'],,,,,,,
58:56.400," Now, to terraform Mars, if we could raise the temperature of Mars by six degrees, six degrees, then the polar ice caps begin to melt, releasing water vapor.",False,,"['Mars/LOC', 'Mars/LOC', 'six_degree/QUANTITY', 'six_degree/QUANTITY']",,,,"['Mars', 'Mars']",,,,,,,
59:08.480, Water vapor is a greenhouse gas.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,
59:10.600, It causes even more melting of the ice caps.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,
59:13.400, So it becomes a self fulfilling prophecy.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,
59:17.120, It feeds on itself.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,
59:18.880, It becomes autocatalytic.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,
59:21.240," And so once you hit six degrees, rising of the temperature on Mars by six degrees, it takes off.",False,,"['six_degree/QUANTITY', 'Mars/LOC', 'six_degree/QUANTITY']",,,,['Mars'],,,,,,,
59:27.200, And we melt the polar ice caps.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,

59:38.440," Mars once had an ocean, we think, about the size of the United States.",False,,"['Mars/LOC', 'United_States/GPE']",,,['United_States'],['Mars'],,,,,,,
59:42.080, And so that is a possibility.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,
59:44.320," Now, how do we get there? How do we raise the temperature of Mars by six degrees? Elon Musk would like to detonate hydrogen warheads on the polar ice caps.",False,,"['Mars/LOC', 'six_degree/QUANTITY', 'Elon_Musk/PERSON']",['Elon_Musk'],,,['Mars'],,,,,,,
59:53.680," Well, I'm not sure about that.",False,,,,,,,,,,,,,
59:56.880, Because we don't know that much about the effects of detonating hydrogen warheads to melt the polar ice caps.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1:00:03.520, And who wants to glow in the dark at night reading the newspaper? So I think there are other ways to do it with solar satellites.,False,,['night/TIME'],,,,,,,,,,['night'],
1:00:12.000," You can have satellites orbiting Mars that beam sunlight onto the polar ice caps, melting the polar ice caps.",False,,['Mars/LOC'],,,,['Mars'],,,,,,,
1:00:19.480, Mars has plenty of water.,False,,['Mars/LOC'],,,,['Mars'],,,,,,,
1:00:21.440, It's just frozen.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,
