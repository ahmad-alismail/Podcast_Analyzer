00:00:00.000;You've mentioned that we just might make contact with aliens, or at least hear from
00:00:06.280;them within this century.
00:00:08.920;Can you elaborate on your intuition behind that optimism?
00:00:12.280;Well, this is pure speculation, of course.
00:00:15.000;Of course.
00:00:16.000;But given the fact that we've already identified 4,000 exoplanets orbiting other stars, and
00:00:21.960;we have a census of the Milky Way galaxy for the first time, we know that on average, every
00:00:28.440;single star, on average, has a planet going around it, and about one-fifth or so of them
00:00:34.580;have Earth-sized planets going around them.
00:00:38.400;So just do the math.
00:00:40.080;We're talking about, out of 100 billion stars in the Milky Way galaxy, we're talking about
00:00:45.860;billions of potential Earth-sized planets.
00:00:50.200;And to believe that we're the only one is, I think, rather ridiculous, given the odds.
00:00:56.420;But how many galaxies are there?
00:00:59.060;Within sight of the Hubble Space Telescope, there are about 100 billion galaxies.
00:01:05.040;So do the math.
00:01:06.840;How many stars are there in the visible universe?
00:01:09.500;A hundred billion galaxies times a hundred billion stars per galaxy, we're talking about
00:01:17.400;a number beyond human imagination.
00:01:20.980;And to believe that we're the only ones, I think, is rather ridiculous.
00:01:25.400;So you've talked about different types of, type 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 even, of the Kardashev
00:01:32.600;scale of the different kinds of civilizations.
00:01:37.800;What do you think it takes, if it is indeed a ridiculous notion that we're alone in the
00:01:42.320;universe, what do you think it takes to reach out, first to reach out through communication
00:01:48.080;and connect?
00:01:49.760;Well first of all, we have to understand the level of sophistication of an alien life form,
00:01:55.840;if we make contact with them.
00:01:57.400;I think in this century, we'll probably pick up signals.
00:02:01.800;Signals from an extraterrestrial civilization will pick up their I Love Lucy and their Leave
00:02:06.760;It to Beaver, just ordinary day-to-day transmissions that they emit.
00:02:12.920;And the first thing we want to do is to A, decipher their language, of course, but B,
00:02:18.000;figure out at what level they are advanced on the Kardashev scale.
00:02:24.080;I'm a physicist.
00:02:25.720;We rank things by two parameters, energy and information.
00:02:30.880;That's how we rank black holes, that's how we rank stars, that's how we rank civilizations
00:02:36.000;in outer space.
00:02:37.760;So a type 1 civilization is capable of harnessing planetary power.
00:02:44.640;They control the weather, for example, earthquakes, volcanoes, they can modify the course of geological
00:02:50.640;events, sort of like Flash Gordon or Buck Rogers.
00:02:55.640;Type 2 would be stellar.
00:02:59.360;They play with stars, entire stars.
00:03:02.740;They use the entire energy output of a star, sort of like Star Trek.
00:03:07.640;The Federation of Planets have colonized the nearby stars, so a type 2 would be somewhat
00:03:13.840;similar to Star Trek.
00:03:16.240;Type 3 would be galactic, they roam the galactic space lanes.
00:03:21.160;And type 3 would be like Star Wars, a galactic civilization.
00:03:26.960;Then one day I was giving this talk in London, at the planetarium there, and the little boy
00:03:31.480;comes up to me and he says, Professor, you're wrong, you're wrong, there's type 4.
00:03:38.120;And I told him, look kid, there are planets, stars, and galaxies, that's it, folks.
00:03:45.880;And he kept persisting and saying, no, there's type 4, the power of the continuum.
00:03:52.920;And I thought about it for a moment, and I said to myself, is there an extra galactic
00:03:57.800;source of energy, the continuum of Star Trek?
00:04:01.600;And the answer is yes, there could be a type 4, and that's dark energy.
00:04:07.120;We now know that 73% of the energy of the universe is dark energy.
00:04:14.760;Dark matter represents maybe 23% or so, and we only represent 4%, we're the oddballs.
00:04:21.760;And so you begin to realize that yeah, there could be type 4, maybe even type 5.
00:04:26.800;So type 4, you're saying, being able to harness sort of like dark energy, something that permeates
00:04:33.200;the entire universe.
00:04:34.280;So being able to plug into the entire universe as a source of energy.
00:04:39.360;That's right.
00:04:40.360;And dark energy is the energy of the Big Bang.
00:04:43.000;It's why the galaxies are being pushed apart, it's the energy of nothing.
00:04:47.800;The more nothing you have, the more dark energy that's repulsive, and so the acceleration
00:04:54.100;of the universe is accelerating because the more you have, the more you can have.
00:04:59.800;And that of course is by definition an exponential curve.
00:05:02.900;It's called the de Sitter expansion, and that's the current state of the universe.
