00:00:00; The following is a conversation with Michio Kaku.
00:00:02; He's a theoretical physicist, futurist,
00:00:05; and professor at the City College of New York.
00:00:08; He's the author of many fascinating books
00:00:10; that explore the nature of our reality
00:00:12; and the future of our civilization.
00:00:15; They include Einstein's Cosmos, Physics of the Impossible,
00:00:19; Future of the Mind, Parallel Worlds,
00:00:21; and his latest, The Future of Humanity,
00:00:24; Terraforming Mars Interstellar Travel,
00:00:26; Immortality, and Our Destiny Beyond Earth.
00:00:29; I think it's beautiful and important
00:00:32; when a scientific mind can fearlessly explore
00:00:35; through conversation subjects
00:00:37; just outside of our understanding.
00:00:40; That, to me, is where artificial intelligence is today,
00:00:43; just outside of our understanding,
00:00:45; a place we have to reach for
00:00:47; if we're to uncover the mysteries of the human mind
00:00:50; and build human level and superhuman level AI systems
00:00:53; that transform our world for the better.
00:00:56; This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.

00:01:09; And now, here's my conversation with Michio Kaku.
00:01:14; You've mentioned that we just might make contact
00:01:17; with aliens or at least hear from them within this century.
00:01:21; Can you elaborate on your intuition behind that optimism?
00:01:25; Well, this is pure speculation, of course.
00:01:28; Of course.
00:01:28; Given the fact that we've already identified
00:01:31; 4,000 exoplanets orbiting other stars,
00:01:34; and we have a census of the Milky Way galaxy
00:01:37; for the first time,
00:01:39; we know that on average, every single star, on average,
00:01:43; has a planet going around it,
00:01:45; and about one fifth or so of them
00:01:47; have Earth sized planets going around them.
00:01:51; So just do the math.
00:01:52; We're talking about out of 100 billion stars
00:01:56; in the Milky Way galaxy,
00:01:58; we're talking about billions
00:01:59; of potential Earth sized planets.
00:02:02; And to believe that we're the only one
00:02:05; is, I think, rather ridiculous, given the odds.
00:02:09; And how many galaxies are there?
00:02:11; Within sight of the Hubble Space Telescope,
00:02:14; there are about 100 billion galaxies.
00:02:17; So do the math.
00:02:19; How many stars are there in the visible universe?
00:02:22; 100 billion galaxies,
00:02:24; times 100 billion stars per galaxy.
00:02:29; We're talking about a number beyond human imagination.
00:02:33; And to believe that we're the only ones,
00:02:35; I think, is rather ridiculous.
00:02:38; So you've talked about different types of,
00:02:42; type zero, one, two, three, four, and five,
00:02:44; even, of the Kardashev scale
00:02:47; of the different kind of civilizations.
00:02:50; What do you think it takes,
00:02:52; if it is indeed a ridiculous notion
00:02:54; that we're alone in the universe,
00:02:56; what do you think it takes to reach out?
00:02:58; First, to reach out through communication and connect.
00:03:02; Well, first of all, we have to understand
00:03:04; the level of sophistication of an alien life form
00:03:08; if we make contact with them.
00:03:10; I think in this century, we'll probably pick up signals,
00:03:14; signals from an extraterrestrial civilization.
00:03:17; We'll pick up there, I love Lucy,
00:03:19; and there, leave it to Beaver.
00:03:21; Just ordinary day to day transmissions
00:03:23; that they emit.
00:03:25; And the first thing we wanna do is to A,
00:03:28; decipher their language, of course,
00:03:30; but B, figure out at what level they are advanced
00:03:34; on the Kardashev scale.
00:03:37; I'm a physicist.
00:03:38; We rank things by two parameters, energy and information.
00:03:43; That's how we rank black holes.
00:03:45; That's how we rank stars.
00:03:47; That's how we rank civilizations in outer space.
00:03:50; So a type one civilization is capable
00:03:54; of harnessing planetary power.
00:03:57; They control the weather, for example, earthquakes, volcanoes.
00:04:01; They can modify the course of geological events,
00:04:04; sort of like Flash Gordon or Buck Rogers.
00:04:08; Type two would be stellar.
00:04:12; They play with stars, entire stars.
00:04:15; They use the entire energy output of a star,
00:04:18; sort of like Star Trek.
00:04:20; The Federation of Planets have colonized the nearby stars.
00:04:24; So a type two would be somewhat similar to Star Trek.
00:04:29; Type three would be galactic.
00:04:30; They roam the galactic space lanes.
00:04:33; And type three would be like Star Wars,
00:04:37; a galactic civilization.
00:04:39; Now, one day I was giving this talk in London
00:04:42; at the planetarium there, and the little boy comes up to me
00:04:45; and he says, professor, you're wrong.
00:04:48; You're wrong, there's type four.
00:04:51; And I told him, look, kid,
00:04:53; there are planets, stars, and galaxies.
00:04:57; That's it, folks.
00:04:58; And he kept persisting and saying, no, there's type four,
00:05:02; the power of the continuum.
00:05:05; And I thought about it for a moment.
00:05:07; And I said to myself,
00:05:08; is there an extra galactic source of energy,
00:05:12; the continuum of Star Trek?
00:05:14; And the answer is yes, there could be a type four.
00:05:18; And that's dark energy.
00:05:20; We now know that 73% of the energy of the universe
00:05:25; is dark energy.
00:05:27; Dark matter represents maybe 23% or so,
00:05:30; and we only represent 4%.
00:05:33; We're the oddballs.
00:05:34; And so you begin to realize that, yeah,
00:05:36; there could be type four, maybe even type five.
00:05:39; So type four, you're saying being able to harness
00:05:43; sort of like dark energy,
00:05:45; something that permeates the entire universe.
00:05:47; So be able to plug into the entire universe
00:05:51; as a source of energy.
00:05:52; That's right.
00:05:52; And dark energy is the energy of the Big Bang.
00:05:55; It's why the galaxies are being pushed apart.
00:05:58; It's the energy of nothing.
00:06:00; The more nothing you have,
00:06:02; the more dark energy that's repulsive.
00:06:05; And so the acceleration of the universe is accelerating
00:06:08; because the more you have, the more you can have.
00:06:12; And that, of course, is by definition an exponential curve.
00:06:15; It's called a de Sitter expansion,
00:06:17; and that's the current state of the universe.
00:06:20; And then type five, would that be able to seek
00:06:26; energy sources somehow outside of our universe?
00:06:31; And how crazy is that idea?
00:06:33; Yeah, type five will be the multiverse.
00:06:35; Multiverse, okay.
00:06:36; I'm a quantum physicist,
00:06:37; and we quantum physicists don't believe
00:06:40; that the Big Bang happened once.
00:06:42; That would violate the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.
00:06:45; And that means that there could be multiple bangs
00:06:47; happening all the time.
00:06:49; Even as we speak today,
00:06:52; universes are being created, and that fits the data.
00:06:56; The inflationary universe is a quantum theory.
00:06:59; So there's a certain finite probability
00:07:02; that universes are being created all the time.
00:07:05; And for me, this is actually rather aesthetically pleasing
00:07:08; because I was raised as a Presbyterian,
00:07:13; but my parents were Buddhists.
00:07:15; And there's two diametrically opposed ideas
00:07:19; about the universe.
00:07:21; In Buddhism, there's only nirvana.
00:07:23; There's no beginning, there's no end,
00:07:25; there's only timelessness.
00:07:26; But in Christianity, there is the instant
00:07:29; when God said, let there be light.
00:07:32; In other words, an instant of creation.
00:07:35; So I've had these two mutually exclusive ideas in my head,
00:07:40; and I now realize that it's possible to meld them
00:07:42; into a single theory.
00:07:45; Either the universe had a beginning or it didn't, right?
00:07:48; Wrong.
00:07:49; You see, our universe had a beginning.
00:07:53; Our universe had an instant where somebody might have said,
00:07:56; let there be light.
00:07:57; But there are other bubble universes out there
00:08:00; in a bubble bath of universes.
00:08:02; And that means that these universes are expanding
00:08:07; into a dimension beyond our three dimensional comprehension.
00:08:11; In other words, hyperspace.
00:08:13; In other words, 11 dimensional hyperspace.
00:08:16; So nirvana would be this timeless 11 dimensional hyperspace
00:08:21; where big bangs are happening all the time.
00:08:24; So we can now combine two mutually exclusive theories
00:08:28; of creation.
00:08:30; And Stephen Hawking, for example, even in his last book,
00:08:35; even said that this is an argument
00:08:37; against the existence of God.
00:08:39; He said there is no God because there was not enough time
00:08:42; for God to create the universe
00:08:44; because the big bang happened in an instant of time.
00:08:47; Therefore, there was no time available
00:08:50; for him to create the universe.
00:08:52; But you see, the multiverse idea
00:08:54; means that there was a time before time.
00:08:58; And there are multiple times, each bubble has its own time.
00:09:01; And so it means that there could actually be a universe
00:09:06; before the beginning of our universe.
00:09:09; So if you think of a bubble bath, when two bubbles collide,
00:09:13; or when two bubbles fission to create a baby bubble,
00:09:16; that's called the big bang.
00:09:18; So the big bang is nothing but the collision of universes
00:09:21; or the budding of universes.
00:09:23; That's such a beautiful picture
00:09:25; of our incredibly mysterious existence.
00:09:28; So is that humbling to you?
00:09:30; Exciting, the idea of multiverses?
00:09:32; I don't even know how to even begin
00:09:35; to wrap my mind around it.
00:09:37; It's exciting for me
00:09:38; because what I do for a living is string theory.
00:09:41; That's my day job.
00:09:43; I get paid by the city of New York to work on string theory.
00:09:46; And you see, string theory is a multiverse theory.
00:09:50; So people say, first of all, what is string theory?
00:09:53; String theory simply says that all the particles
00:09:55; we see in nature, the electron, the proton,
00:09:58; the quarks, what have you,
00:09:59; are nothing but vibrations on a musical string,
00:10:03; on a tiny, tiny little string.
00:10:05; You know, G. Robert Oppenheimer,
00:10:07; the creator of the atomic bomb,
00:10:09; was so frustrated in the 1950s
00:10:12; with all these subatomic particles being created
00:10:15; in our atom smashers that he announced,
00:10:18; he announced one day that the Nobel Prize in physics
00:10:22; should go to the physicist
00:10:23; who does not discover a new particle that year.
00:10:28; Well, today we think they're nothing but musical notes
00:10:30; on these tiny little vibrating strings.
00:10:32; So what is physics?
00:10:34; Physics is the harmonies you can write on vibrating strings.
00:10:38; What is chemistry?
00:10:40; Chemistry is the melodies you can play on these strings.
00:10:44; What is the universe?
00:10:47; The universe is a symphony of strings.
00:10:50; And then what is the mind of God
00:10:53; that Albert Einstein so eloquently wrote about
00:10:55; for the last 30 years of his life?
00:10:58; The mind of God would be cosmic music,
00:11:02; resonating through 11 dimensional hyperspace.
00:11:06; So beautifully put.
00:11:07; What do you think is the mind of Einstein's God?
00:11:11; Do you think there's a why that we could untangle
00:11:16; from this universe of strings?
00:11:19; Why are we here?
00:11:20; What is the meaning of it all?
00:11:23; Well, Steven Weinberg, winner of the Nobel Prize,
00:11:26; once said that the more we learn about the universe,
00:11:29; the more we learn that it's pointless.
00:11:32; Well, I don't know.
00:11:35; I don't profess to understand
00:11:37; the great secrets of the universe.
00:11:39; However, let me say two things
00:11:41; about what the giants of physics
00:11:43; have said about this question.
00:11:45; Einstein believed in two types of God.
00:11:49; One was the God of the Bible, the personal God,
00:11:54; the God that answers prayers, walks on waters,
00:11:56; performs miracles, smites the Philistines.
00:12:00; That's the personal God that he didn't believe in.
00:12:02; He believed in the God of Spinoza,
00:12:05; the God of order, simplicity, harmony, beauty.
00:12:10; The universe could have been ugly.
00:12:12; The universe could have been messy, random,
00:12:15; but it's gorgeous.
00:12:17; You realize that on a single sheet of paper,
00:12:19; we can write down all the known laws of the universe.
00:12:23; It's amazing, on one sheet of paper,
00:12:25; Einstein's equation is one inch long,
00:12:27; string theory is a lot longer,
00:12:30; and so it's a standard model,
00:12:31; but you could put all these equations
00:12:33; on one sheet of paper.
00:12:36; It didn't have to be that way.
00:12:38; It could have been messy.
00:12:40; And so, Einstein thought of himself as a young boy
00:12:43; entering this huge library for the first time,
00:12:47; being overwhelmed by the simplicity, elegance,
00:12:51; and beauty of this library,
00:12:53; but all he could do was read the first page
00:12:56; of the first volume.
00:12:58; Well, that library is the universe,
00:13:00; with all sorts of mysterious, magical things
00:13:03; that we have yet to find.
00:13:05; And then Galileo was asked about this.
00:13:07; Galileo said that the purpose of science,
00:13:13; the purpose of science is to determine how the heavens go.
00:13:17; The purpose of religion is to determine
00:13:20; how to go to heaven.
00:13:22; So in other words, science is about natural law,
00:13:26; and religion is about ethics,
00:13:29; how to be a good person, how to go to heaven.
00:13:32; As long as we keep these two things apart,
00:13:35; we're in great shape.
00:13:36; The problem occurs when people from the natural sciences
00:13:41; begin to pontificate about ethics,
00:13:43; and people from religion begin to pontificate
00:13:46; about natural law.
00:13:47; That's where we get into big trouble.
00:13:50; You think they're fundamentally distinct,
00:13:53; morality and ethics and our idea of what is right
00:13:58; and what is wrong.
00:13:59; That's something that's outside the reach
00:14:02; of string theory and physics.
00:14:03; That's right.
00:14:04; If you talk to a squirrel about what is right
00:14:08; and what is wrong, there's no reference frame
00:14:12; for a squirrel, and realize that aliens from outer space,
00:14:16; if they ever come visit us, they'll try to talk to us
00:14:20; like we talk to squirrels in the forest,
00:14:22; but eventually we get bored talking to the squirrels
00:14:25; because they don't talk back to us.
00:14:28; Same thing with aliens from outer space.
00:14:30; They come down to earth, they'll be curious about us
00:14:32; to a degree, but after a while they just get bored
00:14:35; because we have nothing to offer them.
00:14:37; So our sense of right and wrong,
00:14:40; what does that mean compared to a squirrel's sense
00:14:43; of right and wrong?
00:14:46; Now we of course do have an ethics
00:14:48; that keeps civilizations in line,
00:14:51; enriches our life and makes civilization possible.
00:14:56; And I think that's a good thing,
00:14:58; but it's not mandated by a law of physics.
00:15:01; So if aliens do, alien species were to make contact,
00:15:06; forgive me for staying on aliens for a bit longer.
00:15:10; Do you think they're more likely to be friendly,
00:15:15; to befriend us or to destroy us?
00:15:18; Well, I think for the most part,
00:15:20; they'll pretty much ignore us.
00:15:22; If you're a deer in the forest, who do you fear the most?
00:15:25; Do you fear the hunter with his gigantic 16 gauge shotgun?
00:15:30; Or do you fear the guy with a briefcase and glasses?
00:15:35; Well, the guy with the briefcase could be a developer
00:15:39; about to basically flatten the entire forest,
00:15:42; destroying your livelihood.
00:15:44; So instinctively you may be afraid of the hunter,
00:15:47; but actually the problem with deers in the forest
00:15:51; is that they should fear developers
00:15:54; because developers look at deer as simply
00:15:57; getting in the way.
00:15:59; I mean, in War of the Worlds by H.G. Wells,
00:16:02; the aliens did not hate us.
00:16:04; If you read the book,
00:16:05; the aliens did not have evil intentions toward homo sapiens.
00:16:11; No, we were in the way.
00:16:13; So I think we have to realize that alien civilizations
00:16:18; may view us quite differently than in science fiction novels.
00:16:21; However, I personally believe,
00:16:22; and I cannot prove any of this,
00:16:24; I personally believe that they're probably gonna be peaceful
00:16:27; because there's nothing that they want from our world.
00:16:31; I mean, what are they gonna take us?
00:16:33; What are they gonna take us for, gold?
00:16:35; No, gold is a useless metal for the most part.
00:16:39; It's silver, I mean, it's gold in color,
00:16:43; but that only affects homo sapiens.
00:16:45; Squirrels don't care about gold.
00:16:47; And so gold is a rather useless element.
00:16:50; Rare earths maybe, platinum based elements,
00:16:53; rare earths for the electronics, yeah, maybe.
00:16:55; But other than that, we have nothing to offer them.
00:16:59; I mean, think about it for a moment.
00:17:01; People love Shakespeare and they love the arts and poetry,
00:17:06; but outside of the earth, they mean nothing,
00:17:10; absolutely nothing.
00:17:12; I mean, when I write down an equation in string theory,
00:17:15; I would hope that on the other side of the galaxy,
00:17:19; there's an alien writing down that very same equation
00:17:22; in different notation,
00:17:24; but that alien on the other side of the galaxy,
00:17:27; Shakespeare, poetry, Hemingway,
00:17:30; it would mean nothing to him or her or it.
00:17:33; When you think about entities that's out there,
00:17:38; extraterrestrial, do you think they would naturally look
00:17:43; something that even is recognizable to us as life?
00:17:48; Or would they be radically different?
00:17:50; Well, how did we become intelligent?
00:17:52; Basically three things made us intelligent.
00:17:56; One is our eyesight, stereo eyesight.
00:17:59; We have the eyes of a hunter,
00:18:01; stereo vision so we lock in on targets.
00:18:04; And who is smarter, predator or prey?
00:18:09; Predators are smarter than prey.
00:18:11; They have their eyes at the front of their face,
00:18:13; like lions, tigers,
00:18:15; while rabbits have eyes to the side of their face.
00:18:18; Why is that?
00:18:19; Hunters have to zero in on the target.
00:18:22; They have to know how to ambush.
00:18:24; They have to know how to hide, camouflage,
00:18:27; sneak up, stealth, deceit.
00:18:30; That takes a lot of intelligence.
00:18:31; Rabbits, all they have to do is run.
00:18:35; So that's the first criterion, stereo eyesight of some sort.
00:18:39; Second is the thumb.
00:18:42; The opposable thumb of some sort
00:18:44; could be a claw or a tentacle.
00:18:46; So hand eye coordination.
00:18:48; Hand eye coordination is the way
00:18:50; we manipulate the environment.
00:18:52; And then three, language.
00:18:55; Because mama bear never tells baby bear
00:18:58; to avoid the human hunter.
00:19:00; Bears just learn by themselves.
00:19:02; They never hand out information
00:19:04; from one generation to the next.
00:19:06; So these are the three basic ingredients of intelligence.
00:19:10; Eyesight of some sort, an opposable thumb
00:19:12; or tentacle or claw of some sort, and language.
00:19:16; Now ask yourself a simple question.
00:19:19; How many animals have all three?
00:19:22; Just us.
00:19:23; It's just us.
00:19:25; I mean, the primates, they have a language, yeah,
00:19:28; they may get up to maybe 20 words,
00:19:30; but a baby learns a word a day,
00:19:32; several words a day a baby learns.
00:19:35; And a typical adult knows about almost 5,000 words.
00:19:41; While the maximum number of words
00:19:42; that you can teach a gorilla in any language,
00:19:46; including their own language, is about 20 or so.
00:19:49; And so we see the difference in intelligence.
00:19:53; So when we meet aliens from outer space,
00:19:55; chances are they will have been descended
00:19:58; from predators of some sort.
00:20:01; They'll have some way to manipulate the environment
00:20:03; and communicate their knowledge to the next generation.
00:20:07; That's it, folks.
00:20:09; So functionally, that would be similar.
00:20:12; That would, we would be able to recognize them.
00:20:15; Well, not necessarily, because I think
00:20:17; even with Homo sapiens, we are eventually
00:20:20; going to perhaps become part cybernetic
00:20:24; and genetically enhanced.
00:20:27; Already, robots are getting smarter and smarter.
00:20:31; Right now, robots have the intelligence of a cockroach.
00:20:35; But in the coming years,
00:20:37; our robots will be as smart as a mouse,
00:20:40; then maybe as smart as a rabbit.
00:20:42; If we're lucky, maybe as smart as a cat or a dog.
00:20:47; And by the end of the century, who knows for sure,
00:20:50; our robots will be probably as smart as a monkey.
00:20:53; Now, at that point, of course, they could be dangerous.
00:20:56; You see, monkeys are self aware.
00:20:59; They know they are monkeys.
00:21:03; They may have a different agenda than us.
00:21:06; While dogs, dogs are confused.
00:21:10; You see, dogs think that we are a dog,
00:21:14; that we're the top dog.
00:21:16; They're the underdog.
00:21:17; That's why they whimper and follow us and lick us
00:21:20; all the time.
00:21:21; We're the top dog.
00:21:22; Monkeys have no illusion at all.
00:21:25; They know we are not monkeys.
00:21:28; And so I think that in the future,
00:21:29; we'll have to put a chip in their brain to shut them off
00:21:32; once our robots have murderous thoughts.
00:21:35; But that's in a hundred years.
00:21:37; In 200 years, the robots will be smart enough
00:21:41; to remove that fail safe chip in their brain
00:21:44; and then watch out.
00:21:46; At that point, I think rather than compete with our robots,
00:21:52; we should merge with them.
00:21:54; We should become part cybernetic.
00:21:56; So I think when we meet alien life from outer space,
00:21:59; they may be genetically and cybernetically enhanced.
00:22:05; Genetically and cybernetically enhanced.
00:22:07; Wow, so let's talk about that full range.
00:22:11; In the near term and 200 years from now,
00:22:13; how promising in the near term in your view
00:22:16; is brain machine interfaces?
00:22:18; So starting to allow computers to talk directly
00:22:22; to the brains, Elon Musk is working on that with Neuralink
00:22:26; and there's other companies working on this idea.
00:22:29; Do you see promise there?
00:22:30; Do you see hope for near term impact?
00:22:32; Well, every technology has pluses and minuses.
00:22:36; Already we can record memories.
00:22:38; I have a book, The Future of the Mind,
00:22:40; where I detail some of these breakthroughs.
00:22:42; We can now record simple memories of mice
00:22:46; and send these memories on the internet.
00:22:49; Eventually, we're gonna do this with primates
00:22:52; at Wake Forest University and also in Los Angeles.
00:22:55; And then after that,
00:22:57; we'll have a memory chip for Alzheimer's patients.
00:23:00; We'll test it out in Alzheimer's patients
00:23:02; because of course, when Alzheimer's patients
00:23:05; lose their memory, they wander.
00:23:07; They create all sorts of havoc, wandering around,
00:23:11; oblivious to their surroundings and they'll have a chip.
00:23:15; They'll push the button and memories,
00:23:18; memories will come flooding into their hippocampus
00:23:21; and the chip telling them where they live and who they are.
00:23:26; And so a memory chip is definitely in the cards.
00:23:29; And I think this will eventually affect human civilization.
00:23:33; What is the future of the internet?
00:23:35; The future of the internet is brain net.
00:23:37; Brain net is when we send emotions, feelings,
00:23:41; sensations on the internet.
00:23:44; And we will telepathically communicate
00:23:46; with other humans this way.
00:23:49; This is gonna affect everything.
00:23:51; Look at entertainment.
00:23:52; Remember the silent movies?
00:23:54; Charlie Chaplin was very famous
00:23:56; during the era of silent movies.
00:23:58; But when the talkies came in,
00:23:59; nobody wanted to see Charlie Chaplin anymore
00:24:03; because he never talked in the movies.
00:24:05; And so a whole generation of actors lost their job
00:24:08; and a new series of actors came in.
00:24:11; Next, we're gonna have the movies replaced by brain net
00:24:16; because in the future, people will say,
00:24:19; who wants to see a screen with images?
00:24:23; That's it.
00:24:23; Sound and image, that's called the movies.
00:24:27; In our entertainment industry,
00:24:28; this multi billion dollar industry is based on screens
00:24:32; with moving images and sound.
00:24:34; But what happens when emotions, feelings, sensations,
00:24:39; memories can be conveyed on the internet?
00:24:43; It's gonna change everything.
00:24:44; Human relations will change
00:24:46; because you'll be able to empathize
00:24:47; and feel the suffering of other people.
00:24:50; We'll be able to communicate telepathically.
00:24:53; And this is coming.
00:24:55; You described brain net and future of the mind.
00:24:58; This is an interesting concept.
00:25:00; Do you think, so you mentioned entertainment,
00:25:03; but what kind of effect would it have
00:25:06; on our personal relationships?
00:25:08; Hopefully it will deepen it.
00:25:10; You realize that for most of human history,
00:25:13; for over 90% of human history,
00:25:16; we only knew maybe 20, 100 people.
00:25:22; That's it, folks.
00:25:23; That was your tribe.
00:25:25; That was everybody you knew in the universe
00:25:28; was only maybe 50 or 100.
00:25:31; With the coming of towns,
00:25:33; of course it expanded to a few thousand.
00:25:35; With the coming of the telephone,
00:25:37; all of a sudden you could reach thousands of people
00:25:40; with a telephone.
00:25:41; And now with the internet,
00:25:42; you can reach the entire population of the planet Earth.
00:25:45; And so I think this is a normal progression.
00:25:48; And you think that kind of sort of connection
00:25:52; to the rest of the world,
00:25:53; and then adding sensations
00:25:55; like being able to share telepathically emotions and so on
00:25:58; that would just further deepen our connection
00:26:01; to our fellow humans.
00:26:02; That's right.
00:26:03; In fact, I disagree with many scientists on this question.
00:26:07; Most scientists would say that technology is neutral.
00:26:11; A double edged sword,
00:26:12; one side of the sword can cut against people.
00:26:15; The other side of the sword
00:26:17; can cut against ignorance and disease.
00:26:20; I disagree.
00:26:22; I think technology does have a moral direction.
00:26:25; Look at the internet.
00:26:27; The internet spreads knowledge, awareness,
00:26:30; and that creates empowerment.
00:26:33; People act on knowledge.
00:26:35; When they begin to realize
00:26:36; that they don't have to live that way,
00:26:38; they don't have to suffer under a dictatorship,
00:26:41; that there are other ways of living under freedom,
00:26:44; then they begin to take things, take power.
00:26:47; And that spreads democracy.
00:26:49; And democracies do not war with other democracies.
00:26:54; I'm a scientist.
00:26:55; I believe in data.
00:26:57; So let's take a sheet of paper
00:26:59; and write down every single war you had to learn
00:27:03; since you were in elementary school.
00:27:05; Every single war, hundreds of them.
00:27:07; Kings, queens, emperors, dictators.
00:27:11; All these wars were between kings, queens,
00:27:13; emperors, and dictators.
00:27:15; Never between two major democracies.
00:27:19; And so I think with the spread of this technology
00:27:22; and which would accelerate with the coming of brain net,
00:27:26; it means that, well, we will still have wars.
00:27:28; Wars, of course, is politics by other means,
00:27:31; but they'll be less intense and less frequent.
00:27:35; Do you have worries of longer term existential risk
00:27:40; from technology, from AI?
00:27:43; So I think that's a wonderful vision of a future
00:27:48; where war is a distant memory,
00:27:51; but now there's another agent.
00:27:53; There's somebody else that's able to create conflict,
00:27:57; that's able to create harm, AI systems.
00:28:00; So do you have worry about such AI systems?
00:28:03; Well, yes, that is an existential risk,
00:28:05; but again, I think an existential risk,
00:28:07; not for this century.
00:28:09; I think our grandkids are gonna have to confront
00:28:12; this question as robots gradually approach
00:28:15; the intelligence of a dog, a cat,
00:28:17; and finally that of a monkey.
00:28:20; However, I think we will digitize ourselves as well.
00:28:23; Not only are we gonna merge with our technology,
00:28:26; we'll also digitize our personality,
00:28:28; our memories, our feelings.
00:28:30; You realize during the Middle Ages,
00:28:32; there was something called dualism.
00:28:34; Dualism meant that the soul was separate from the body.
00:28:38; When the body died, the soul went to heaven.
00:28:40; That's dualism.
00:28:42; Then in the 20th century, neuroscience came in
00:28:45; and said, bah, humbug.
00:28:47; Every time we look at the brain, it's just neurons.
00:28:50; That's it, folks, period, end of story.
00:28:54; Bunch of neurons firing.
00:28:56; Now we're going back to dualism.
00:28:59; Now we realize that we can digitize human memories,
00:29:03; feelings, sensations, and create a digital copy of ourselves,
00:29:09; and that's called the Connectome Project.
00:29:11; Billions of dollars are now being spent
00:29:14; to do not just the genome project
00:29:17; of sequencing the genes of our body,
00:29:19; but the Connectome Project,
00:29:21; which is to map the entire connections of the human brain.
00:29:26; And even before then, already in Silicon Valley,
00:29:28; today, at this very moment,
00:29:31; you can contact Silicon Valley companies
00:29:33; that are willing to digitize your relatives
00:29:36; because some people want to talk to their parents.
00:29:39; There are unresolved issues with their parents,
00:29:42; and one day, yes, firms will digitize people,
00:29:45; and you'll be able to talk to them a reasonable facsimile.
00:29:49; We leave a digital trail.
00:29:52; Our ancestors did not.
00:29:54; Our ancestors were lucky if they had one line,
00:29:57; just one line in a church book,
00:30:00; saying the date they were baptized and the date they died.
00:30:04; That's it.
00:30:05; That was their entire digital memory.
00:30:08; I mean, their entire digital existence summarized
00:30:11; in just a few letters of the alphabet, a whole life.
00:30:15; Now we digitize everything.
00:30:17; Every time you sneeze, you digitize it.
00:30:20; You put it on the internet.
00:30:22; And so I think that we are gonna digitize ourselves
00:30:25; and give us digital immortality.
00:30:28; We'll not only have biologic genetic immortality
00:30:31; of some sort, but also digital immortality.
00:30:34; And what are we gonna do with it?
00:30:37; I think we should send it into outer space.
00:30:40; If you digitize the human brain
00:30:43; and put it on a laser beam and shoot it to the moon,
00:30:46; you're on the moon in one second.
00:30:48; Shoot it to Mars, you're on Mars in 20 minutes.
00:30:51; Shoot it to Pluto, you're on Pluto in eight hours.
00:30:54; Think about it for a moment.
00:30:56; You can have breakfast in New York
00:30:58; and for a morning snack, vacation on the moon,
00:31:02; then zap your way to Mars by noontime,
00:31:05; journey through the asteroid belt of the afternoon,
00:31:08; and then come back for dinner in New York at night.
00:31:11; All in a day's work at the speed of light.
00:31:16; Now, this means that you don't need booster rockets.
00:31:19; You don't need weightlessness problems.
00:31:21; You don't need to worry about meteorites.
00:31:23; And what's on the moon?
00:31:25; On the moon, there is a mainframe
00:31:27; that downloads your laser beam's information.
00:31:31; And where does it download the information into?
00:31:34; An avatar.
00:31:35; Now, what does that avatar look like?
00:31:37; Anything you want.
00:31:40; Think about it for a moment.
00:31:41; You could be Superman, Superwoman, on the moon, on Mars,
00:31:47; traveling throughout the universe at the speed of light,
00:31:50; downloading your personality into any vehicle you want.
00:31:55; Now, let me stick my neck out.
00:31:57; So far, everything I've been saying
00:31:58; is well within the laws of physics.
00:32:00; Well within the laws of physics.
00:32:02; Now, let me go outside the laws of physics again.
00:32:04; Here we go.
00:32:05; I think this already exists.
00:32:08; I think outside the Earth, there could be a super highway
00:32:11; a laser highway of laser porting
00:32:14; with billions of souls of aliens
00:32:17; zapping their way across the galaxy.
00:32:20; Now, let me ask you a question.
00:32:22; Are we smart enough to determine
00:32:25; whether such a thing exists or not?
00:32:28; No, this could exist right outside
00:32:31; the orbit of the planet Earth.
00:32:32; And we're too stupid in our technology
00:32:35; to even prove it or disprove it.
00:32:38; We would need the aliens on this laser super highway
00:32:43; to help us out, to send us a human interpretable signal.
00:32:50; I mean, it ultimately boils down
00:32:51; to the language of communication,
00:32:53; but that's an exciting possibility
00:32:55; that actually the sky is filled with aliens.
00:32:59; The aliens could already be here.
00:33:00; And we're just so oblivious that we're too stupid to know it.
00:33:05; See, they don't have to be in alien form
00:33:07; with little green men.
00:33:09; They can be in any form they want
00:33:11; in an avatar of their creation.
00:33:13; Well, in fact, they could very well be.
00:33:16; They can even look like us.
00:33:17; Exactly.
00:33:18; We'd never know.
00:33:19; One of us could be an alien.
00:33:21; You know, in the zoo, did you know
00:33:22; that we sometimes have zookeepers that imitate animals?
00:33:26; We create a fake animal and we put it in
00:33:29; so that the animal is not afraid of this fake animal.
00:33:33; And of course, these animals brains,
00:33:35; their brain is about as big as a walnut.
00:33:37; They accept these dummies as if they were real.
00:33:41; So an alien civilization in outer space would say,
00:33:44; oh yeah, human brains are so tiny.
00:33:46; We could put a dummy on their world, an avatar,
00:33:49; and they'd never know it.
00:33:51; That would be an entertaining thing to watch
00:33:53; from the alien perspective.
00:33:55; So you kind of implied that with a digital form
00:33:58; of our being, but also biologically,
00:34:02; do you think one day technology will allow
00:34:04; individual human beings to become immortal
00:34:07; besides just through the ability to digitize our essence?
00:34:11; Yeah, I think that artificial intelligence
00:34:13; will give us the key to genetic immortality.
00:34:17; You see, in the coming decades,
00:34:18; everyone's gonna have their gene sequence.
00:34:21; We'll have billions of genomes of old people,
00:34:24; billions of genomes of young people.
00:34:26; And what are we gonna do with it?
00:34:28; We're gonna run it through an AI machine,
00:34:30; which has pattern recognition, to look for the age genes.
00:34:35; In other words, the fountain of youth that emperors,
00:34:38; kings, and queens lusted over.
00:34:41; The fountain of youth will be found
00:34:44; by artificial intelligence.
00:34:46; Artificial intelligence will identify
00:34:48; where these age genes are located.
00:34:52; First of all, what is aging?
00:34:53; We now know what aging is.
00:34:55; Aging is the buildup of errors.
00:34:59; That's all aging is, the buildup of genetic errors.
00:35:03; This means that cells eventually become slower, sluggish,
00:35:07; they go into senescence, and they die.
00:35:10; In fact, that's why we die.
00:35:13; We die because of the buildup of mistakes
00:35:16; in our genome, in our cellular activity.
00:35:20; But you see, in the future, we'll be able to fix those genes
00:35:23; with CRISPR type technologies,
00:35:25; and perhaps even live forever.
00:35:27; So let me ask you a question.
00:35:29; Where does aging take place in a car?
00:35:32; Given a car, where does aging take place?
00:35:34; Well, it's obvious, the engine, right?
00:35:37; A, that's where you have a lot of moving parts.
00:35:39; B, that's where you have combustion.
00:35:41; Well, where in the cell do we have combustion?
00:35:47; The mitochondria.
00:35:48; We now know where aging takes place.
00:35:52; And if we cure many of the mistakes that build up
00:35:55; in the mitochondria of the cell, we could become immortal.
00:35:59; Let me ask you, if you yourself could become immortal,
00:36:03; would you?
00:36:06; Damn straight.
00:36:07; No, I think about it for a while,
00:36:10; because of course, it depends on how you become immortal.
00:36:14; You know, there's a famous myth of Tithonus.
00:36:17; It turns out that years ago, in the Greek mythology,
00:36:21; there was the saga of Tithonus and Aurora.
00:36:25; Aurora was the goddess of the dawn,
00:36:28; and she fell in love with a mortal, a human called Tithonus.
00:36:32; And so Aurora begged Zeus to grant her
00:36:37; the gift of immortality to give to her lover.
00:36:42; So Zeus took pity on Aurora and made Tithonus immortal.
00:36:47; But you see, Aurora made a mistake,
00:36:49; a huge mistake.
00:36:52; She asked for immortality,
00:36:54; but she forgot to ask for eternal youth.
00:36:59; So poor Tithonus got older and older and older every year,
00:37:03; decrepit, a bag of bones, but he could never die.
00:37:08; Never die.
00:37:09; Quality of life is important.
00:37:11; So I think immortality is a great idea,
00:37:14; as long as you also have immortal youth as well.
00:37:18; Now, I personally believe, and I cannot prove this,
00:37:20; but I personally believe that our grandkids
00:37:22; may have the option of reaching the age of 30
00:37:26; and then stopping.
00:37:28; They may like being age 30,
00:37:30; because you have wisdom,
00:37:32; you have all the benefits of age and maturity,
00:37:35; and you still live forever with a healthy body.
00:37:39; Our descendants may like being 30 for several centuries.
00:37:43; Is there an aspect of human existence
00:37:45; that is meaningful only because we're mortal?
00:37:49; Well, every waking moment,
00:37:52; we don't think about it this way,
00:37:53; but every waking moment,
00:37:55; actually, we are aware of our death and our mortality.
00:38:00; Think about it for a moment.
00:38:01; When you go to college,
00:38:03; you realize that you are in a period of time
00:38:05; where soon you will reach middle age and have a career.
00:38:10; And after that, you'll retire and then you'll die.
00:38:13; And so even as a youth, even as a child,
00:38:17; without even thinking about it,
00:38:19; you are aware of your own death,
00:38:21; because it sets limits to your lifespan.
00:38:24; I gotta graduate from high school.
00:38:26; I gotta graduate from college.
00:38:27; Why?
00:38:28; Because you're gonna die.
00:38:30; Because unless you graduate from high school,
00:38:32; unless you graduate from college,
00:38:34; you're not gonna enter old age with enough money
00:38:37; to retire and then die.
00:38:39; And so, yeah, people think about it unconsciously,
00:38:42; because it affects every aspect of your being.
00:38:46; The fact that you go to high school, college,
00:38:49; get married, have kids, there's a clock,
00:38:52; a clock ticking even without your permission.
00:38:56; It gives a sense of urgency.
00:38:58; Do you yourself, I mean,
00:39:01; there's so much excitement and passion
00:39:03; in the way you talk about physics
00:39:04; and the way you talk about technology in the future.
00:39:07; Do you yourself meditate on your own mortality?
00:39:11; Do you think about this clock that's ticking?
00:39:14; Well, I try not to,
00:39:15; because it then begins to affect your behavior.
00:39:19; You begin to alter your behavior
00:39:21; to match your expectation of when you're gonna die.
00:39:26; So let's talk about youth,
00:39:27; and then let's talk about death, okay?
00:39:31; When I interview scientists on radio,
00:39:34; I often ask them, what made the difference?
00:39:37; How old were you?
00:39:39; What changed your life?
00:39:41; And they always say more or less the same thing.
00:39:44; No, these are Nobel Prize winners,
00:39:45; directors of major laboratories,
00:39:47; very distinguished scientists.
00:39:48; They always say, when I was 10,
00:39:52; when I was 10, something happened.
00:39:55; It was a visit to the planetarium.
00:39:57; It was a telescope.
00:39:59; For Steven Weinberg, winner of the Nobel Prize,
00:40:01; it was the chemistry kit.
00:40:03; For Heinz Pagels, it was a visit to the planetarium.
00:40:07; For Isidor Rabi, it was a book about the planets.
00:40:10; For Albert Einstein, it was a compass.
00:40:14; Something happened,
00:40:15; which gives them this existential shock.
00:40:18; Because you see, before the age of 10,
00:40:20; everything is mommy and daddy, mommy and dad.
00:40:22; That's your universe, mommy and daddy.
00:40:25; Around the age of 10, you begin to wonder,
00:40:27; what's beyond mommy and daddy?
00:40:30; And that's when you have this epiphany,
00:40:33; when you realize, oh my God, there's a universe out there,
00:40:38; a universe of discovery.
00:40:40; And that sensation stays with you for the rest of your life.
00:40:45; You still remember that shock
00:40:47; that you felt gazing at the universe.
00:40:50; And then you hit the greatest destroyer of scientists
00:40:55; known to science.
00:40:57; The greatest destroyer of scientists known to science
00:41:02; is junior high school.
00:41:05; When you hit junior high school, folks, it's all over.
00:41:08; It's all over.
00:41:10; Because in junior high school, people say, hey, stupid.
00:41:14; I mean, you like that nerdy stuff.
00:41:17; And your friends shun you.
00:41:19; All of a sudden, people think you're a weirdo.
00:41:22; And scientists made boring.
00:41:25; Richard Feynman, the Nobel Prize winner,
00:41:27; when he was a child,
00:41:29; his father would take him into the forest.
00:41:31; And the father would teach him everything about birds,
00:41:35; why they're shaped the way they are,
00:41:36; their wings, the coloration, the shape of their beak,
00:41:40; everything about birds.
00:41:43; So one day, a bully comes up
00:41:44; to the future Nobel Prize winner and says,
00:41:47; hey, Dick, what's the name of that bird over there?
00:41:51; Well, he didn't know.
00:41:53; He knew everything about that bird except its name.
00:41:58; So he said, I don't know.
00:42:00; And then the bully said, what's the matter, Dick?
00:42:03; You stupid or something?
00:42:05; And then in that instant, he got it.
00:42:08; He got it.
00:42:09; He realized that for most people,
00:42:12; science is giving names to birds.
00:42:15; That's what science is.
00:42:17; You know lots of names of obscure things.
00:42:19; Hey, people say, you're smart.
00:42:21; You're smart.
00:42:22; You know all the names of the dinosaurs.
00:42:24; You know all the names of the plants.
00:42:26; No, that's not science at all.
00:42:29; Science is about principles, concepts, physical pictures.
00:42:36; That's what science is all about.
00:42:38; My favorite quote from Einstein is that,
00:42:41; unless you can explain the theory to a child,
00:42:44; the theory is probably worthless.
00:42:47; Meaning that all great theories are not big words.
00:42:52; All great theories are simple concepts, principles,
00:42:57; basic physical pictures.
00:43:00; Relativity is all about clocks, meter sticks,
00:43:04; rocket ships and locomotives.
00:43:07; Newton's laws of gravity are all about balls
00:43:10; and spinning wheels and things like that.
00:43:13; That's what physics and science is all about,
00:43:15; not memorizing things.
00:43:17; And that stays with you for the rest of your life.
00:43:20; So even in old age, I've noticed that these scientists,
00:43:24; when they sit back, they still remember.
00:43:28; They still remember that flush,
00:43:30; that flush of excitement they felt with that first telescope,
00:43:34; that first moment when they encountered the universe.
00:43:38; That keeps them going.
00:43:40; That keeps them going.
00:43:42; By the way, I should point out that when I was eight,
00:43:46; something happened to me as well.
00:43:49; When I was eight years old, it was in all the papers
00:43:53; that a great scientist had just died.
00:43:56; And they put a picture of his desk on the front page.
00:44:00; That's it, just a simple picture of the front page
00:44:03; of the newspapers of his desk.
00:44:06; That desk had a book on it, which was opened.
00:44:09; And the caption said more or less,
00:44:11; this is the unfinished manuscript
00:44:14; from the greatest scientists of our time.
00:44:17; So I said to myself, well, why couldn't he finish it?
00:44:22; What's so hard that you can't finish it
00:44:25; if you're a great scientist?
00:44:26; It's a homework problem, right?
00:44:28; You go home, you solve it, or you ask your mom,
00:44:32; why couldn't he solve it?
00:44:33; So to me, this was a murder mystery.
00:44:35; This was greater than any adventure story.
00:44:37; I had to know why the greatest scientists of our time
00:44:41; couldn't finish something.
00:44:43; And then over the years, I found out the guy had a name,
00:44:46; Albert Einstein, and that book was The Theory of Everything.
00:44:51; It was unfinished.
00:44:53; Well, today I can read that book.
00:44:55; I can see all the dead ends and false starts that he made.
00:44:59; And I began to realize that he lost his way
00:45:02; because he didn't have a physical picture
00:45:05; to guide him on the third try.
00:45:09; On the first try, he talked about clocks
00:45:12; and lightning bolts and meter sticks,
00:45:15; and that gave us special relativity,
00:45:17; which gave us the atomic bomb.
00:45:19; The second great picture was gravity
00:45:23; with balls rolling on curved surfaces.
00:45:26; And that gave us the Big Bang,
00:45:28; creation of the universe, black holes.
00:45:30; On the third try, he missed it.
00:45:34; He had no picture at all to guide him.
00:45:38; In fact, there's a quote I have where he said,
00:45:40; I'm still looking.
00:45:41; I'm still looking for that picture.
00:45:44; He never found it.
00:45:45; Well, today we think that picture is strength theory.
00:45:49; The strength theory can unify gravity
00:45:52; and this mysterious thing that Einstein didn't like,
00:45:54; which is quantum mechanics,
00:45:55; or couldn't quite pin down and make sense of.
00:45:59; That's right.
00:46:00; Mother nature has two hands, a left hand and a right hand.
00:46:02; The left hand is a theory of the small.
00:46:05; The right hand is a theory of the big.
00:46:07; The theory of the small is the quantum theory,
00:46:09; the theory of atoms and quarks.
00:46:11; The theory of the big is relativity,
00:46:13; the theory of black holes, big bangs.
00:46:16; The problem is the left hand does not talk to the right hand.
00:46:22; They hate each other.
00:46:24; The left hand is based on discrete particles.
00:46:27; The right hand is based on smooth surfaces.
00:46:31; How do you put these two things together
00:46:33; into a single theory?
00:46:34; They hate each other.
00:46:35; The greatest minds of our time,
00:46:38; the greatest minds of our time
00:46:40; worked on this problem and failed.
00:46:43; Today, the only theory that has survived
00:46:46; every challenge so far is string theory.
00:46:49; That doesn't mean string theory is correct.
00:46:51; It could very well be wrong,
00:46:53; but right now it's the only game in town.
00:46:56; Some people come up to me and say,
00:46:57; ''Professor, I don't believe in string theory.
00:47:00; Give me an alternative.''
00:47:02; And I tell them there is none.
00:47:05; Get used to it.
00:47:07; It's the best theory we got.
00:47:09; It's the only theory we have.
00:47:10; It's the only theory we have.
00:47:13; Do you see, you know,
00:47:16; the strings kind of inspire a view,
00:47:20; as did atoms and particles and quarks,
00:47:23; but especially strings inspire a view of a universe
00:47:26; as a kind of information processing system,
00:47:29; as a computer of sorts.
00:47:31; Do you see the universe in this way?
00:47:33; No.
00:47:34; Some people think, in fact,
00:47:36; the whole universe is a computer of some sort.
00:47:39; And they believe that perhaps everything,
00:47:42; therefore, is a simulation.
00:47:44; Yes.
00:47:45; I don't think so.
00:47:46; I don't think that there is a super video game
00:47:49; where we are nothing but puppets dancing on the screen
00:47:52; and somebody hit the play button
00:47:54; and here we are talking about simulations.
00:47:57; No.
00:47:58; Even Newtonian mechanics says that the weather,
00:48:02; the simple weather is so complicated
00:48:04; with trillions upon trillions of atoms
00:48:07; that it cannot be simulated in a finite amount of time.
00:48:10; In other words, the smallest object
00:48:13; which can describe the weather
00:48:17; and simulate the weather is the weather itself.
00:48:21; The smallest object that can simulate a human
00:48:24; is the human itself.
00:48:26; And if you had quantum mechanics,
00:48:28; it becomes almost impossible
00:48:31; to simulate it with a conventional computer.
00:48:34; This quantum mechanics deals with all possible universes,
00:48:38; parallel universes, a multiverse of universes.
00:48:42; And so the calculation just spirals out of control.
00:48:46; Now, so far, there's only one way
00:48:49; where you might be able to argue
00:48:52; that the universe is a simulation.
00:48:54; And this is still being debated by quantum physicists.
00:48:58; It turns out that if you throw the encyclopedia
00:49:00; into a black hole, the information is not lost.
00:49:04; Eventually it winds up on the surface of the black hole.
00:49:07; Now, the surface of the black hole is finite.
00:49:09; In fact, you can calculate
00:49:11; the maximum amount of information
00:49:13; you can store in a black hole.
00:49:15; It's a finite number.
00:49:17; It's a calculable number, believe it or not.
00:49:19; Now, if the universe were made out of black holes,
00:49:21; which is the maximum universe you can conceive of,
00:49:25; each universe, each black hole
00:49:27; has a finite amount of information.
00:49:29; Therefore, ergo, da da!
00:49:32; Ergo, the total amount of information in a universe
00:49:37; is finite.
00:49:38; This is mind boggling.
00:49:40; This, I consider mind boggling,
00:49:42; that all possible universes are countable
00:49:46; and all possible universes can be summarized in a number,
00:49:50; a number you can write on a sheet of paper,
00:49:52; all possible universes, and it's a finite number.
00:49:55; Now, it's huge.
00:49:56; It's a number beyond human imagination.
00:49:59; It's a number based on what is called a Planck length,
00:50:01; but it's a number.
00:50:03; And so if a computer could ever simulate that number,
00:50:07; then the universe would be a simulation.
00:50:10; So theoretically, because the amount of information
00:50:13; is finite, well, there necessarily must be able
00:50:18; to exist a computer.
00:50:19; It's just, from an engineering perspective,
00:50:21; maybe impossible to build.
00:50:24; Yes, no computer can build a universe
00:50:26; capable of simulating the entire universe,
00:50:29; except the universe itself.
00:50:31; So that's your intuition, that our universe
00:50:34; is very efficient, and so there's no shortcuts.
00:50:37; Right, two reasons why I believe the universe
00:50:40; is not a simulation.
00:50:41; First, the calculational numbers are just incredible.
00:50:44; No finite Turing machine can simulate the universe.
00:50:48; And second, why would any super intelligent being
00:50:52; simulate humans?
00:50:54; If you think about it, most humans are kind of stupid.
00:50:57; I mean, we do all sorts of crazy, stupid things, right?
00:51:01; And we call it art, we call it humor.
00:51:03; We call it human civilization.
00:51:06; So why should an advanced civilization
00:51:08; go through all that effort just to simulate Saturday Night
00:51:12; Live?
00:51:14; Well, that's a funny idea, but it's also,
00:51:16; do you think it's possible that the act of creation
00:51:20; cannot anticipate humans?
00:51:22; You simply set the initial conditions
00:51:23; and set a bunch of physical laws,
00:51:26; and just for the fun of it, see what happens.
00:51:28; You launch the thing, so you're not necessarily
00:51:30; simulating everything.
00:51:31; You're not simulating every little bit in the sense
00:51:35; that you could predict what's going to happen,
00:51:37; but you set the initial conditions, set the laws,
00:51:40; and see what kind of fun stuff happens.
00:51:43; Well, in some sense, that's how life got started.
00:51:46; In the 1950s, Stanley did what is called
00:51:50; the Miller experiment.
00:51:51; He put a bunch of hydrogen gas, methane, toxic gases
00:51:57; with liquid and a spark in a small glass beaker.
00:52:02; And then he just walked away for a few weeks,
00:52:05; came back a few weeks later, and bingo.
00:52:08; Out of nothing and chaos came amino acids.
00:52:12; If he had left it there for a few years,
00:52:14; he might have gotten protein, protein molecules for free.
00:52:19; That's probably how life got started, as a accident.
00:52:23; And if he had left it there for perhaps a few million years,
00:52:26; DNA might have formed in that beaker.
00:52:30; And so we think that, yeah, DNA, life, all that
00:52:34; could have been an accident if you wait long enough.
00:52:38; And remember, our universe is roughly 13.8 billion years old.
00:52:42; That's plenty of time for lots of random things
00:52:45; to happen, including life itself.
00:52:51; Yeah, we could be just a beautiful little random moment.
00:52:56; And there could be an infinite number
00:52:59; of those throughout the history of the universe,
00:53:02; many creatures like us.
00:53:04; We perhaps are not the epitome of what
00:53:06; the universe is created for.
00:53:07; Thank God.
00:53:09; Let's hope not.
00:53:11; Just look around.
00:53:12; Yeah.
00:53:13; Look to your left, look to your right.
00:53:16; When do you think the first human will step foot on Mars?
00:53:20; I think it's a good chance in the 2030s
00:53:23; that we will be on Mars.
00:53:25; In fact, there's no physics reason why we can't do it.
00:53:29; It's an engineering problem.
00:53:31; It's a very difficult and dangerous engineering problem,
00:53:34; but it is an engineering problem.
00:53:36; And in my book, Future of Humanity,
00:53:38; I even speculate beyond that, that by the end
00:53:41; of this century, we'll probably have the first starships.
00:53:45; The first starships will not look
00:53:47; like the Enterprise at all.
00:53:49; They'll probably be small computer chips
00:53:51; that are fired by laser beams with parachutes.
00:53:54; And like what Stephen Hawking advocated,
00:53:58; the Breakthrough Starshot program
00:54:00; could send ships to the nearby stars,
00:54:02; traveling at 20% the speed of light,
00:54:05; reaching Alpha Centauri in about 20 years time.
00:54:09; Beyond that, we should have fusion power.
00:54:12; Fusion power is, in some sense, one
00:54:15; of the ultimate sources of energy, but it's unstable.
00:54:19; And we don't have fusion power today.
00:54:22; Now, why is that?
00:54:23; First of all, stars form almost for free.
00:54:26; You get a bunch of gas large enough, it becomes a star.
00:54:29; I mean, you don't even have to do anything to it,
00:54:31; and it becomes a star.
00:54:33; Why is fusion so difficult to put on the Earth?
00:54:37; Because in outer space, stars are monopoles.
00:54:40; They are pole, single poles that are spherically symmetric.
00:54:44; And it's very easy to get spherically symmetric
00:54:47; configurations of gas to compress into a star.
00:54:51; It just happens naturally all by itself.
00:54:53; The problem is magnetism is bipolar.
00:54:56; You have a North Pole and a South Pole.
00:54:59; And it's like trying to squeeze a long balloon.
00:55:02; Take a long balloon and try to squeeze it.
00:55:04; You squeeze one side, it bulges out the other side.
00:55:08; Well, that's the problem with fusion machines.
00:55:10; We use magnetism with a North Pole and a South Pole
00:55:13; to squeeze gas, and all sorts of anomalies
00:55:17; and horrible configurations can take place
00:55:20; because we're not squeezing something uniformly
00:55:23; like in a star.
00:55:24; Stars, in some sense, are for free.
00:55:27; Fusion on the Earth is very difficult.
00:55:31; But I think it's inevitable.
00:55:32; And it'll eventually give us unlimited power from seawater.
00:55:37; So seawater will be the ultimate source of energy
00:55:39; for the planet Earth.
00:55:41; Why?
00:55:41; What's the intuition there?
00:55:42; Because we'll extract hydrogen from seawater,
00:55:45; burn hydrogen in a fusion reactor
00:55:47; to give us unlimited energy without the meltdown,
00:55:52; without the nuclear waste.
00:55:53; Why do we have meltdowns?
00:55:55; We have meltdowns because in the fusion reactors,
00:55:57; every time you split the uranium atom, you get nuclear waste.
00:56:00; Tons of it.
00:56:01; 30 tons of nuclear waste per reactor per year.
00:56:07; And it's hot.
00:56:08; It's hot for thousands, millions of years.
00:56:11; That's why we have meltdowns.
00:56:13; But you see, the waste product of a fusion reactor
00:56:15; is helium gas.
00:56:17; Helium gas is actually commercially valuable.
00:56:19; You can make money selling helium gas.
00:56:22; And so the waste product of a fusion reactor
00:56:24; is helium, not nuclear waste that we find
00:56:28; in a commercial fission plant.
00:56:30; And that controlling, mastering and controlling fusion
00:56:34; allows us to, converts us into a type one,
00:56:38; I guess, civilization, right?
00:56:40; Yeah, probably the backbone of a type one civilization
00:56:43; will be fusion power.
00:56:45; We, by the way, are type zero.
00:56:47; We don't even rate on this scale.
00:56:49; We get our energy from dead plants, for God's sake,
00:56:52; oil and coal.
00:56:53; But we are about 100 years from being type one.
00:56:56; Get a calculator.
00:56:57; In fact, Carl Sagan calculated that we
00:56:59; are about 0.7, fairly close to a 1.0.
00:57:05; For example, what is the internet?
00:57:08; The internet is the beginning of the first type one technology
00:57:12; to enter into our century.
00:57:14; The first planetary technology is the internet.
00:57:17; What is the language of type one?
00:57:19; On the internet already, English and Mandarin Chinese
00:57:23; are the most dominant languages on the internet.
00:57:26; And what about the culture?
00:57:29; We're seeing a type one sports, soccer, the Olympics,
00:57:34; a type one music, youth culture, rock and roll, rap music,
00:57:38; type one fashion, Gucci, Chanel, a type one economy,
00:57:42; the European Union, NAFTA, what have you.
00:57:45; So we're beginning to see the beginnings of a type one
00:57:49; culture in a type one civilization.
00:57:52; And inevitably, it will spread beyond this planet.
00:57:56; So you talked about sending at 20% the speed of light
00:58:00; on a chip into Alpha Centauri.
00:58:04; But in a slightly nearer term, what
00:58:07; do you think about the idea when we still have to send
00:58:11; our biological bodies the colonization of planets,
00:58:15; colonization of Mars?
00:58:16; Do you see us becoming a two planet species ever
00:58:21; or anytime soon?
00:58:23; Well, just remember the dinosaurs
00:58:26; did not have a space program.
00:58:28; And that's why they're not here today.
00:58:30; How come there are no dinosaurs in this room today?
00:58:33; Because they didn't have a space program.
00:58:35; We do have a space program, which
00:58:38; means that we have an insurance policy.
00:58:40; Now, I don't think we should bankrupt the Earth
00:58:43; or deplete the Earth to go to Mars.
00:58:44; That's too expensive and not practical.
00:58:47; But we need a settlement, a settlement on Mars
00:58:50; in case something bad happens to the planet Earth.
00:58:53; And that means we have to terraform Mars.
00:58:56; Now, to terraform Mars, if we could
00:58:58; raise the temperature of Mars by six degrees, six degrees,
00:59:03; then the polar ice caps begin to melt, releasing water vapor.
00:59:08; Water vapor is a greenhouse gas.
00:59:10; It causes even more melting of the ice caps.
00:59:13; So it becomes a self fulfilling prophecy.
00:59:17; It feeds on itself.
00:59:18; It becomes autocatalytic.
00:59:21; And so once you hit six degrees, rising
00:59:24; of the temperature on Mars by six degrees, it takes off.
00:59:27; And we melt the polar ice caps.
00:59:29; And liquid water once again flows
00:59:32; in the rivers, the canals, the channels,
00:59:35; and the oceans of Mars.
00:59:38; Mars once had an ocean, we think,
00:59:39; about the size of the United States.
00:59:42; And so that is a possibility.
00:59:44; Now, how do we get there?
00:59:46; How do we raise the temperature of Mars by six degrees?
00:59:49; Elon Musk would like to detonate hydrogen warheads
00:59:51; on the polar ice caps.
00:59:53; Well, I'm not sure about that.
00:59:56; Because we don't know that much about the effects
00:59:59; of detonating hydrogen warheads to melt the polar ice caps.
01:00:03; And who wants to glow in the dark at night reading
01:00:05; the newspaper?
01:00:07; So I think there are other ways to do it
01:00:09; with solar satellites.
01:00:12; You can have satellites orbiting Mars that beam sunlight
01:00:16; onto the polar ice caps, melting the polar ice caps.
01:00:19; Mars has plenty of water.
01:00:21; It's just frozen.
01:00:24; I think you paint an inspiring and a wonderful picture
01:00:27; of the future.
01:00:29; I think you've inspired and educated thousands,
01:00:35; if not millions.
01:00:36; Michio, it's been an honor.
01:00:37; Thank you so much for talking today.
01:00:39; My pleasure.
