00:00:00.000; The following is a conversation with Michio Kaku.
00:00:02.800; He's a theoretical physicist, futurist,
00:00:05.120; and professor at the City College of New York.
00:00:08.360; He's the author of many fascinating books
00:00:10.760; that explore the nature of our reality
00:00:12.840; and the future of our civilization.
00:00:15.520; They include Einstein's Cosmos, Physics of the Impossible,
00:00:19.200; Future of the Mind, Parallel Worlds,
00:00:21.600; and his latest, The Future of Humanity,
00:00:24.240; Terraforming Mars Interstellar Travel,
00:00:26.640; Immortality, and Our Destiny Beyond Earth.
00:00:29.960; I think it's beautiful and important
00:00:32.960; when a scientific mind can fearlessly explore
00:00:35.760; through conversation subjects
00:00:37.600; just outside of our understanding.
00:00:40.200; That, to me, is where artificial intelligence is today,
00:00:43.440; just outside of our understanding,
00:00:45.680; a place we have to reach for
00:00:47.440; if we're to uncover the mysteries of the human mind
00:00:50.160; and build human level and superhuman level AI systems
00:00:53.880; that transform our world for the better.
00:00:56.640; This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.

00:01:09.920; And now, here's my conversation with Michio Kaku.
00:01:14.680; You've mentioned that we just might make contact
00:01:17.360; with aliens or at least hear from them within this century.
00:01:21.740; Can you elaborate on your intuition behind that optimism?
00:01:25.880; Well, this is pure speculation, of course.
00:01:28.120; Of course.
00:01:28.960; Given the fact that we've already identified
00:01:31.200; 4,000 exoplanets orbiting other stars,
00:01:34.560; and we have a census of the Milky Way galaxy
00:01:37.560; for the first time,
00:01:39.160; we know that on average, every single star, on average,
00:01:43.560; has a planet going around it,
00:01:45.640; and about one fifth or so of them
00:01:47.720; have Earth sized planets going around them.
00:01:51.240; So just do the math.
00:01:52.960; We're talking about out of 100 billion stars
00:01:56.160; in the Milky Way galaxy,
00:01:58.140; we're talking about billions
00:01:59.820; of potential Earth sized planets.
00:02:02.880; And to believe that we're the only one
00:02:05.760; is, I think, rather ridiculous, given the odds.
00:02:09.160; And how many galaxies are there?
00:02:11.600; Within sight of the Hubble Space Telescope,
00:02:14.560; there are about 100 billion galaxies.
00:02:17.880; So do the math.
00:02:19.680; How many stars are there in the visible universe?
00:02:22.500; 100 billion galaxies,
00:02:24.780; times 100 billion stars per galaxy.
00:02:29.360; We're talking about a number beyond human imagination.
00:02:33.720; And to believe that we're the only ones,
00:02:35.480; I think, is rather ridiculous.
00:02:38.200; So you've talked about different types of,
00:02:42.180; type zero, one, two, three, four, and five,
00:02:44.500; even, of the Kardashev scale
00:02:47.200; of the different kind of civilizations.
00:02:50.440; What do you think it takes,
00:02:52.780; if it is indeed a ridiculous notion
00:02:54.640; that we're alone in the universe,
00:02:56.220; what do you think it takes to reach out?
00:02:58.720; First, to reach out through communication and connect.
00:03:02.660; Well, first of all, we have to understand
00:03:04.320; the level of sophistication of an alien life form
00:03:08.720; if we make contact with them.
00:03:10.520; I think in this century, we'll probably pick up signals,
00:03:14.160; signals from an extraterrestrial civilization.
00:03:17.400; We'll pick up there, I love Lucy,
00:03:19.260; and there, leave it to Beaver.
00:03:21.280; Just ordinary day to day transmissions
00:03:23.500; that they emit.
00:03:25.600; And the first thing we wanna do is to A,
00:03:28.200; decipher their language, of course,
00:03:30.260; but B, figure out at what level they are advanced
00:03:34.980; on the Kardashev scale.
00:03:37.080; I'm a physicist.
00:03:38.560; We rank things by two parameters, energy and information.
00:03:43.640; That's how we rank black holes.
00:03:45.600; That's how we rank stars.
00:03:47.320; That's how we rank civilizations in outer space.
00:03:50.600; So a type one civilization is capable
00:03:54.900; of harnessing planetary power.
00:03:57.540; They control the weather, for example, earthquakes, volcanoes.
00:04:01.280; They can modify the course of geological events,
00:04:04.600; sort of like Flash Gordon or Buck Rogers.
00:04:08.400; Type two would be stellar.
00:04:12.240; They play with stars, entire stars.
00:04:15.620; They use the entire energy output of a star,
00:04:18.440; sort of like Star Trek.
00:04:20.560; The Federation of Planets have colonized the nearby stars.
00:04:24.640; So a type two would be somewhat similar to Star Trek.
00:04:29.080; Type three would be galactic.
00:04:30.660; They roam the galactic space lanes.
00:04:33.840; And type three would be like Star Wars,
00:04:37.700; a galactic civilization.
00:04:39.880; Now, one day I was giving this talk in London
00:04:42.320; at the planetarium there, and the little boy comes up to me
00:04:45.580; and he says, professor, you're wrong.
00:04:48.760; You're wrong, there's type four.
00:04:51.000; And I told him, look, kid,
00:04:53.360; there are planets, stars, and galaxies.
00:04:57.000; That's it, folks.
00:04:58.720; And he kept persisting and saying, no, there's type four,
00:05:02.680; the power of the continuum.
00:05:05.800; And I thought about it for a moment.
00:05:07.560; And I said to myself,
00:05:08.600; is there an extra galactic source of energy,
00:05:12.220; the continuum of Star Trek?
00:05:14.520; And the answer is yes, there could be a type four.
00:05:18.080; And that's dark energy.
00:05:20.040; We now know that 73% of the energy of the universe
00:05:25.480; is dark energy.
00:05:27.560; Dark matter represents maybe 23% or so,
00:05:30.640; and we only represent 4%.
00:05:33.040; We're the oddballs.
00:05:34.640; And so you begin to realize that, yeah,
00:05:36.400; there could be type four, maybe even type five.
00:05:39.760; So type four, you're saying being able to harness
00:05:43.280; sort of like dark energy,
00:05:45.360; something that permeates the entire universe.
00:05:47.120; So be able to plug into the entire universe
00:05:51.000; as a source of energy.
00:05:52.080; That's right.
00:05:52.920; And dark energy is the energy of the Big Bang.
00:05:55.680; It's why the galaxies are being pushed apart.
00:05:58.920; It's the energy of nothing.
00:06:00.740; The more nothing you have,
00:06:02.560; the more dark energy that's repulsive.
00:06:05.400; And so the acceleration of the universe is accelerating
00:06:08.960; because the more you have, the more you can have.
00:06:12.560; And that, of course, is by definition an exponential curve.
00:06:15.780; It's called a de Sitter expansion,
00:06:17.600; and that's the current state of the universe.
00:06:20.480; And then type five, would that be able to seek
00:06:26.800; energy sources somehow outside of our universe?
00:06:31.040; And how crazy is that idea?
00:06:33.000; Yeah, type five will be the multiverse.
00:06:35.400; Multiverse, okay.
00:06:36.280; I'm a quantum physicist,
00:06:37.760; and we quantum physicists don't believe
00:06:40.280; that the Big Bang happened once.
00:06:42.120; That would violate the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.
00:06:45.120; And that means that there could be multiple bangs
00:06:47.880; happening all the time.
00:06:49.360; Even as we speak today,
00:06:52.120; universes are being created, and that fits the data.
00:06:56.180; The inflationary universe is a quantum theory.
00:06:59.960; So there's a certain finite probability
00:07:02.060; that universes are being created all the time.
00:07:05.120; And for me, this is actually rather aesthetically pleasing
00:07:08.740; because I was raised as a Presbyterian,
00:07:13.200; but my parents were Buddhists.
00:07:15.920; And there's two diametrically opposed ideas
00:07:19.520; about the universe.
00:07:21.080; In Buddhism, there's only nirvana.
00:07:23.240; There's no beginning, there's no end,
00:07:25.160; there's only timelessness.
00:07:26.940; But in Christianity, there is the instant
00:07:29.960; when God said, let there be light.
00:07:32.760; In other words, an instant of creation.
00:07:35.320; So I've had these two mutually exclusive ideas in my head,
00:07:40.160; and I now realize that it's possible to meld them
00:07:42.760; into a single theory.
00:07:45.120; Either the universe had a beginning or it didn't, right?
00:07:48.640; Wrong.
00:07:49.880; You see, our universe had a beginning.
00:07:53.160; Our universe had an instant where somebody might have said,
00:07:56.240; let there be light.
00:07:57.860; But there are other bubble universes out there
00:08:00.340; in a bubble bath of universes.
00:08:02.720; And that means that these universes are expanding
00:08:07.280; into a dimension beyond our three dimensional comprehension.
00:08:11.240; In other words, hyperspace.
00:08:13.080; In other words, 11 dimensional hyperspace.
00:08:16.360; So nirvana would be this timeless 11 dimensional hyperspace
00:08:21.680; where big bangs are happening all the time.
00:08:24.860; So we can now combine two mutually exclusive theories
00:08:28.640; of creation.
00:08:30.920; And Stephen Hawking, for example, even in his last book,
00:08:35.320; even said that this is an argument
00:08:37.120; against the existence of God.
00:08:39.320; He said there is no God because there was not enough time
00:08:42.680; for God to create the universe
00:08:44.320; because the big bang happened in an instant of time.
00:08:47.800; Therefore, there was no time available
00:08:50.400; for him to create the universe.
00:08:52.360; But you see, the multiverse idea
00:08:54.600; means that there was a time before time.
00:08:58.040; And there are multiple times, each bubble has its own time.
00:09:01.920; And so it means that there could actually be a universe
00:09:06.240; before the beginning of our universe.
00:09:09.640; So if you think of a bubble bath, when two bubbles collide,
00:09:13.640; or when two bubbles fission to create a baby bubble,
00:09:16.800; that's called the big bang.
00:09:18.800; So the big bang is nothing but the collision of universes
00:09:21.520; or the budding of universes.
00:09:23.720; That's such a beautiful picture
00:09:25.080; of our incredibly mysterious existence.
00:09:28.000; So is that humbling to you?
00:09:30.240; Exciting, the idea of multiverses?
00:09:32.840; I don't even know how to even begin
00:09:35.000; to wrap my mind around it.
00:09:37.640; It's exciting for me
00:09:38.480; because what I do for a living is string theory.
00:09:41.680; That's my day job.
00:09:43.040; I get paid by the city of New York to work on string theory.
00:09:46.840; And you see, string theory is a multiverse theory.
00:09:50.520; So people say, first of all, what is string theory?
00:09:53.400; String theory simply says that all the particles
00:09:55.640; we see in nature, the electron, the proton,
00:09:58.240; the quarks, what have you,
00:09:59.840; are nothing but vibrations on a musical string,
00:10:03.240; on a tiny, tiny little string.
00:10:05.920; You know, G. Robert Oppenheimer,
00:10:07.400; the creator of the atomic bomb,
00:10:09.640; was so frustrated in the 1950s
00:10:12.040; with all these subatomic particles being created
00:10:15.160; in our atom smashers that he announced,
00:10:18.240; he announced one day that the Nobel Prize in physics
00:10:22.680; should go to the physicist
00:10:23.960; who does not discover a new particle that year.
00:10:28.280; Well, today we think they're nothing but musical notes
00:10:30.600; on these tiny little vibrating strings.
00:10:32.960; So what is physics?
00:10:34.720; Physics is the harmonies you can write on vibrating strings.
00:10:38.600; What is chemistry?
00:10:40.160; Chemistry is the melodies you can play on these strings.
00:10:44.840; What is the universe?
00:10:47.040; The universe is a symphony of strings.
00:10:50.280; And then what is the mind of God
00:10:53.200; that Albert Einstein so eloquently wrote about
00:10:55.720; for the last 30 years of his life?
00:10:58.400; The mind of God would be cosmic music,
00:11:02.760; resonating through 11 dimensional hyperspace.
00:11:06.160; So beautifully put.
00:11:07.280; What do you think is the mind of Einstein's God?
00:11:11.880; Do you think there's a why that we could untangle
00:11:16.160; from this universe of strings?
00:11:19.760; Why are we here?
00:11:20.920; What is the meaning of it all?
00:11:23.320; Well, Steven Weinberg, winner of the Nobel Prize,
00:11:26.280; once said that the more we learn about the universe,
00:11:29.760; the more we learn that it's pointless.
00:11:32.240; Well, I don't know.
00:11:35.600; I don't profess to understand
00:11:37.280; the great secrets of the universe.
00:11:39.320; However, let me say two things
00:11:41.120; about what the giants of physics
00:11:43.320; have said about this question.
00:11:45.320; Einstein believed in two types of God.
00:11:49.320; One was the God of the Bible, the personal God,
00:11:54.280; the God that answers prayers, walks on waters,
00:11:56.560; performs miracles, smites the Philistines.
00:12:00.040; That's the personal God that he didn't believe in.
00:12:02.640; He believed in the God of Spinoza,
00:12:05.480; the God of order, simplicity, harmony, beauty.
00:12:10.040; The universe could have been ugly.
00:12:12.840; The universe could have been messy, random,
00:12:15.680; but it's gorgeous.
00:12:17.360; You realize that on a single sheet of paper,
00:12:19.960; we can write down all the known laws of the universe.
00:12:23.120; It's amazing, on one sheet of paper,
00:12:25.400; Einstein's equation is one inch long,
00:12:27.840; string theory is a lot longer,
00:12:30.040; and so it's a standard model,
00:12:31.960; but you could put all these equations
00:12:33.880; on one sheet of paper.
00:12:36.880; It didn't have to be that way.
00:12:38.640; It could have been messy.
00:12:40.240; And so, Einstein thought of himself as a young boy
00:12:43.160; entering this huge library for the first time,
00:12:47.480; being overwhelmed by the simplicity, elegance,
00:12:51.160; and beauty of this library,
00:12:53.160; but all he could do was read the first page
00:12:56.560; of the first volume.
00:12:58.320; Well, that library is the universe,
00:13:00.320; with all sorts of mysterious, magical things
00:13:03.240; that we have yet to find.
00:13:05.280; And then Galileo was asked about this.
00:13:07.920; Galileo said that the purpose of science,
00:13:13.000; the purpose of science is to determine how the heavens go.
00:13:17.680; The purpose of religion is to determine
00:13:20.680; how to go to heaven.
00:13:22.400; So in other words, science is about natural law,
00:13:26.200; and religion is about ethics,
00:13:29.480; how to be a good person, how to go to heaven.
00:13:32.320; As long as we keep these two things apart,
00:13:35.000; we're in great shape.
00:13:36.960; The problem occurs when people from the natural sciences
00:13:41.080; begin to pontificate about ethics,
00:13:43.360; and people from religion begin to pontificate
00:13:46.200; about natural law.
00:13:47.880; That's where we get into big trouble.
00:13:50.800; You think they're fundamentally distinct,
00:13:53.720; morality and ethics and our idea of what is right
00:13:58.360; and what is wrong.
00:13:59.360; That's something that's outside the reach
00:14:02.080; of string theory and physics.
00:14:03.960; That's right.
00:14:04.800; If you talk to a squirrel about what is right
00:14:08.680; and what is wrong, there's no reference frame
00:14:12.520; for a squirrel, and realize that aliens from outer space,
00:14:16.600; if they ever come visit us, they'll try to talk to us
00:14:20.560; like we talk to squirrels in the forest,
00:14:22.520; but eventually we get bored talking to the squirrels
00:14:25.880; because they don't talk back to us.
00:14:28.040; Same thing with aliens from outer space.
00:14:30.000; They come down to earth, they'll be curious about us
00:14:32.280; to a degree, but after a while they just get bored
00:14:35.440; because we have nothing to offer them.
00:14:37.920; So our sense of right and wrong,
00:14:40.480; what does that mean compared to a squirrel's sense
00:14:43.400; of right and wrong?
00:14:46.560; Now we of course do have an ethics
00:14:48.720; that keeps civilizations in line,
00:14:51.840; enriches our life and makes civilization possible.
00:14:56.480; And I think that's a good thing,
00:14:58.040; but it's not mandated by a law of physics.
00:15:01.560; So if aliens do, alien species were to make contact,
00:15:06.960; forgive me for staying on aliens for a bit longer.
00:15:10.920; Do you think they're more likely to be friendly,
00:15:15.640; to befriend us or to destroy us?
00:15:18.680; Well, I think for the most part,
00:15:20.560; they'll pretty much ignore us.
00:15:22.880; If you're a deer in the forest, who do you fear the most?
00:15:25.920; Do you fear the hunter with his gigantic 16 gauge shotgun?
00:15:30.480; Or do you fear the guy with a briefcase and glasses?
00:15:35.400; Well, the guy with the briefcase could be a developer
00:15:39.040; about to basically flatten the entire forest,
00:15:42.400; destroying your livelihood.
00:15:44.200; So instinctively you may be afraid of the hunter,
00:15:47.720; but actually the problem with deers in the forest
00:15:51.320; is that they should fear developers
00:15:54.160; because developers look at deer as simply
00:15:57.360; getting in the way.
00:15:59.440; I mean, in War of the Worlds by H.G. Wells,
00:16:02.560; the aliens did not hate us.
00:16:04.760; If you read the book,
00:16:05.960; the aliens did not have evil intentions toward homo sapiens.
00:16:11.360; No, we were in the way.
00:16:13.560; So I think we have to realize that alien civilizations
00:16:18.000; may view us quite differently than in science fiction novels.
00:16:21.080; However, I personally believe,
00:16:22.800; and I cannot prove any of this,
00:16:24.560; I personally believe that they're probably gonna be peaceful
00:16:27.320; because there's nothing that they want from our world.
00:16:31.720; I mean, what are they gonna take us?
00:16:33.360; What are they gonna take us for, gold?
00:16:35.360; No, gold is a useless metal for the most part.
00:16:39.360; It's silver, I mean, it's gold in color,
00:16:43.600; but that only affects homo sapiens.
00:16:45.640; Squirrels don't care about gold.
00:16:47.760; And so gold is a rather useless element.
00:16:50.560; Rare earths maybe, platinum based elements,
00:16:53.160; rare earths for the electronics, yeah, maybe.
00:16:55.720; But other than that, we have nothing to offer them.
00:16:59.280; I mean, think about it for a moment.
00:17:01.640; People love Shakespeare and they love the arts and poetry,
00:17:06.560; but outside of the earth, they mean nothing,
00:17:10.200; absolutely nothing.
00:17:12.320; I mean, when I write down an equation in string theory,
00:17:15.800; I would hope that on the other side of the galaxy,
00:17:19.760; there's an alien writing down that very same equation
00:17:22.880; in different notation,
00:17:24.720; but that alien on the other side of the galaxy,
00:17:27.240; Shakespeare, poetry, Hemingway,
00:17:30.360; it would mean nothing to him or her or it.
00:17:33.960; When you think about entities that's out there,
00:17:38.080; extraterrestrial, do you think they would naturally look
00:17:43.880; something that even is recognizable to us as life?
00:17:48.000; Or would they be radically different?
00:17:50.560; Well, how did we become intelligent?
00:17:52.840; Basically three things made us intelligent.
00:17:56.160; One is our eyesight, stereo eyesight.
00:17:59.320; We have the eyes of a hunter,
00:18:01.160; stereo vision so we lock in on targets.
00:18:04.240; And who is smarter, predator or prey?
00:18:09.360; Predators are smarter than prey.
00:18:11.560; They have their eyes at the front of their face,
00:18:13.240; like lions, tigers,
00:18:15.680; while rabbits have eyes to the side of their face.
00:18:18.800; Why is that?
00:18:19.840; Hunters have to zero in on the target.
00:18:22.720; They have to know how to ambush.
00:18:24.560; They have to know how to hide, camouflage,
00:18:27.000; sneak up, stealth, deceit.
00:18:30.160; That takes a lot of intelligence.
00:18:31.960; Rabbits, all they have to do is run.
00:18:35.200; So that's the first criterion, stereo eyesight of some sort.
00:18:39.880; Second is the thumb.
00:18:42.760; The opposable thumb of some sort
00:18:44.640; could be a claw or a tentacle.
00:18:46.120; So hand eye coordination.
00:18:48.640; Hand eye coordination is the way
00:18:50.240; we manipulate the environment.
00:18:52.800; And then three, language.
00:18:55.040; Because mama bear never tells baby bear
00:18:58.200; to avoid the human hunter.
00:19:00.360; Bears just learn by themselves.
00:19:02.360; They never hand out information
00:19:04.040; from one generation to the next.
00:19:06.240; So these are the three basic ingredients of intelligence.
00:19:10.200; Eyesight of some sort, an opposable thumb
00:19:12.960; or tentacle or claw of some sort, and language.
00:19:16.640; Now ask yourself a simple question.
00:19:19.080; How many animals have all three?
00:19:22.400; Just us.
00:19:23.480; It's just us.
00:19:25.200; I mean, the primates, they have a language, yeah,
00:19:28.440; they may get up to maybe 20 words,
00:19:30.720; but a baby learns a word a day,
00:19:32.720; several words a day a baby learns.
00:19:35.120; And a typical adult knows about almost 5,000 words.
00:19:41.000; While the maximum number of words
00:19:42.800; that you can teach a gorilla in any language,
00:19:46.600; including their own language, is about 20 or so.
00:19:49.680; And so we see the difference in intelligence.
00:19:53.080; So when we meet aliens from outer space,
00:19:55.560; chances are they will have been descended
00:19:58.040; from predators of some sort.
00:20:01.040; They'll have some way to manipulate the environment
00:20:03.440; and communicate their knowledge to the next generation.
00:20:07.840; That's it, folks.
00:20:09.000; So functionally, that would be similar.
00:20:12.400; That would, we would be able to recognize them.
00:20:15.880; Well, not necessarily, because I think
00:20:17.920; even with Homo sapiens, we are eventually
00:20:20.960; going to perhaps become part cybernetic
00:20:24.760; and genetically enhanced.
00:20:27.960; Already, robots are getting smarter and smarter.
00:20:31.520; Right now, robots have the intelligence of a cockroach.
00:20:35.720; But in the coming years,
00:20:37.280; our robots will be as smart as a mouse,
00:20:40.480; then maybe as smart as a rabbit.
00:20:42.840; If we're lucky, maybe as smart as a cat or a dog.
00:20:47.200; And by the end of the century, who knows for sure,
00:20:50.200; our robots will be probably as smart as a monkey.
00:20:53.680; Now, at that point, of course, they could be dangerous.
00:20:56.960; You see, monkeys are self aware.
00:20:59.720; They know they are monkeys.
00:21:03.320; They may have a different agenda than us.
00:21:06.160; While dogs, dogs are confused.
00:21:10.600; You see, dogs think that we are a dog,
00:21:14.760; that we're the top dog.
00:21:16.360; They're the underdog.
00:21:17.480; That's why they whimper and follow us and lick us
00:21:20.200; all the time.
00:21:21.320; We're the top dog.
00:21:22.920; Monkeys have no illusion at all.
00:21:25.440; They know we are not monkeys.
00:21:28.280; And so I think that in the future,
00:21:29.960; we'll have to put a chip in their brain to shut them off
00:21:32.960; once our robots have murderous thoughts.
00:21:35.480; But that's in a hundred years.
00:21:37.480; In 200 years, the robots will be smart enough
00:21:41.520; to remove that fail safe chip in their brain
00:21:44.640; and then watch out.
00:21:46.840; At that point, I think rather than compete with our robots,
00:21:52.600; we should merge with them.
00:21:54.800; We should become part cybernetic.
00:21:56.800; So I think when we meet alien life from outer space,
00:21:59.480; they may be genetically and cybernetically enhanced.
00:22:05.360; Genetically and cybernetically enhanced.
00:22:07.720; Wow, so let's talk about that full range.
00:22:11.040; In the near term and 200 years from now,
00:22:13.720; how promising in the near term in your view
00:22:16.920; is brain machine interfaces?
00:22:18.760; So starting to allow computers to talk directly
00:22:22.920; to the brains, Elon Musk is working on that with Neuralink
00:22:26.880; and there's other companies working on this idea.
00:22:29.000; Do you see promise there?
00:22:30.480; Do you see hope for near term impact?
00:22:32.960; Well, every technology has pluses and minuses.
00:22:36.400; Already we can record memories.
00:22:38.600; I have a book, The Future of the Mind,
00:22:40.920; where I detail some of these breakthroughs.
00:22:42.840; We can now record simple memories of mice
00:22:46.360; and send these memories on the internet.
00:22:49.320; Eventually, we're gonna do this with primates
00:22:52.080; at Wake Forest University and also in Los Angeles.
00:22:55.960; And then after that,
00:22:57.720; we'll have a memory chip for Alzheimer's patients.
00:23:00.880; We'll test it out in Alzheimer's patients
00:23:02.840; because of course, when Alzheimer's patients
00:23:05.800; lose their memory, they wander.
00:23:07.760; They create all sorts of havoc, wandering around,
00:23:11.680; oblivious to their surroundings and they'll have a chip.
00:23:15.640; They'll push the button and memories,
00:23:18.240; memories will come flooding into their hippocampus
00:23:21.120; and the chip telling them where they live and who they are.
00:23:26.280; And so a memory chip is definitely in the cards.
00:23:29.520; And I think this will eventually affect human civilization.
00:23:33.200; What is the future of the internet?
00:23:35.080; The future of the internet is brain net.
00:23:37.680; Brain net is when we send emotions, feelings,
00:23:41.680; sensations on the internet.
00:23:44.400; And we will telepathically communicate
00:23:46.640; with other humans this way.
00:23:49.600; This is gonna affect everything.
00:23:51.160; Look at entertainment.
00:23:52.480; Remember the silent movies?
00:23:54.080; Charlie Chaplin was very famous
00:23:56.240; during the era of silent movies.
00:23:58.040; But when the talkies came in,
00:23:59.960; nobody wanted to see Charlie Chaplin anymore
00:24:03.000; because he never talked in the movies.
00:24:05.640; And so a whole generation of actors lost their job
00:24:08.880; and a new series of actors came in.
00:24:11.400; Next, we're gonna have the movies replaced by brain net
00:24:16.960; because in the future, people will say,
00:24:19.480; who wants to see a screen with images?
00:24:23.120; That's it.
00:24:23.960; Sound and image, that's called the movies.
00:24:27.320; In our entertainment industry,
00:24:28.960; this multi billion dollar industry is based on screens
00:24:32.240; with moving images and sound.
00:24:34.680; But what happens when emotions, feelings, sensations,
00:24:39.920; memories can be conveyed on the internet?
00:24:43.200; It's gonna change everything.
00:24:44.800; Human relations will change
00:24:46.280; because you'll be able to empathize
00:24:47.720; and feel the suffering of other people.
00:24:50.280; We'll be able to communicate telepathically.
00:24:53.280; And this is coming.
00:24:55.880; You described brain net and future of the mind.
00:24:58.640; This is an interesting concept.
00:25:00.960; Do you think, so you mentioned entertainment,
00:25:03.920; but what kind of effect would it have
00:25:06.200; on our personal relationships?
00:25:08.600; Hopefully it will deepen it.
00:25:10.360; You realize that for most of human history,
00:25:13.360; for over 90% of human history,
00:25:16.760; we only knew maybe 20, 100 people.
00:25:22.040; That's it, folks.
00:25:23.520; That was your tribe.
00:25:25.000; That was everybody you knew in the universe
00:25:28.400; was only maybe 50 or 100.
00:25:31.720; With the coming of towns,
00:25:33.240; of course it expanded to a few thousand.
00:25:35.640; With the coming of the telephone,
00:25:37.480; all of a sudden you could reach thousands of people
00:25:40.520; with a telephone.
00:25:41.600; And now with the internet,
00:25:42.680; you can reach the entire population of the planet Earth.
00:25:45.520; And so I think this is a normal progression.
00:25:48.400; And you think that kind of sort of connection
00:25:52.320; to the rest of the world,
00:25:53.920; and then adding sensations
00:25:55.360; like being able to share telepathically emotions and so on
00:25:58.880; that would just further deepen our connection
00:26:01.160; to our fellow humans.
00:26:02.920; That's right.
00:26:03.760; In fact, I disagree with many scientists on this question.
00:26:07.680; Most scientists would say that technology is neutral.
00:26:11.200; A double edged sword,
00:26:12.600; one side of the sword can cut against people.
00:26:15.960; The other side of the sword
00:26:17.360; can cut against ignorance and disease.
00:26:20.840; I disagree.
00:26:22.440; I think technology does have a moral direction.
00:26:25.920; Look at the internet.
00:26:27.360; The internet spreads knowledge, awareness,
00:26:30.680; and that creates empowerment.
00:26:33.040; People act on knowledge.
00:26:35.400; When they begin to realize
00:26:36.760; that they don't have to live that way,
00:26:38.520; they don't have to suffer under a dictatorship,
00:26:41.080; that there are other ways of living under freedom,
00:26:44.560; then they begin to take things, take power.
00:26:47.720; And that spreads democracy.
00:26:49.600; And democracies do not war with other democracies.
00:26:54.240; I'm a scientist.
00:26:55.240; I believe in data.
00:26:57.160; So let's take a sheet of paper
00:26:59.080; and write down every single war you had to learn
00:27:03.760; since you were in elementary school.
00:27:05.880; Every single war, hundreds of them.
00:27:07.800; Kings, queens, emperors, dictators.
00:27:11.040; All these wars were between kings, queens,
00:27:13.600; emperors, and dictators.
00:27:15.240; Never between two major democracies.
00:27:19.840; And so I think with the spread of this technology
00:27:22.560; and which would accelerate with the coming of brain net,
00:27:26.120; it means that, well, we will still have wars.
00:27:28.480; Wars, of course, is politics by other means,
00:27:31.520; but they'll be less intense and less frequent.
00:27:35.440; Do you have worries of longer term existential risk
00:27:40.960; from technology, from AI?
00:27:43.440; So I think that's a wonderful vision of a future
00:27:48.120; where war is a distant memory,
00:27:51.200; but now there's another agent.
00:27:53.840; There's somebody else that's able to create conflict,
00:27:57.920; that's able to create harm, AI systems.
00:28:00.920; So do you have worry about such AI systems?
00:28:03.080; Well, yes, that is an existential risk,
00:28:05.440; but again, I think an existential risk,
00:28:07.760; not for this century.
00:28:09.800; I think our grandkids are gonna have to confront
00:28:12.520; this question as robots gradually approach
00:28:15.160; the intelligence of a dog, a cat,
00:28:17.840; and finally that of a monkey.
00:28:20.440; However, I think we will digitize ourselves as well.
00:28:23.760; Not only are we gonna merge with our technology,
00:28:26.160; we'll also digitize our personality,
00:28:28.560; our memories, our feelings.
00:28:30.680; You realize during the Middle Ages,
00:28:32.560; there was something called dualism.
00:28:34.680; Dualism meant that the soul was separate from the body.
00:28:38.200; When the body died, the soul went to heaven.
00:28:40.920; That's dualism.
00:28:42.440; Then in the 20th century, neuroscience came in
00:28:45.440; and said, bah, humbug.
00:28:47.720; Every time we look at the brain, it's just neurons.
00:28:50.920; That's it, folks, period, end of story.
00:28:54.640; Bunch of neurons firing.
00:28:56.840; Now we're going back to dualism.
00:28:59.640; Now we realize that we can digitize human memories,
00:29:03.440; feelings, sensations, and create a digital copy of ourselves,
00:29:09.040; and that's called the Connectome Project.
00:29:11.600; Billions of dollars are now being spent
00:29:14.320; to do not just the genome project
00:29:17.320; of sequencing the genes of our body,
00:29:19.680; but the Connectome Project,
00:29:21.640; which is to map the entire connections of the human brain.
00:29:26.120; And even before then, already in Silicon Valley,
00:29:28.920; today, at this very moment,
00:29:31.320; you can contact Silicon Valley companies
00:29:33.480; that are willing to digitize your relatives
00:29:36.800; because some people want to talk to their parents.
00:29:39.760; There are unresolved issues with their parents,
00:29:42.400; and one day, yes, firms will digitize people,
00:29:45.800; and you'll be able to talk to them a reasonable facsimile.
00:29:49.280; We leave a digital trail.
00:29:52.440; Our ancestors did not.
00:29:54.080; Our ancestors were lucky if they had one line,
00:29:57.600; just one line in a church book,
00:30:00.720; saying the date they were baptized and the date they died.
00:30:04.400; That's it.
00:30:05.280; That was their entire digital memory.
00:30:08.200; I mean, their entire digital existence summarized
00:30:11.520; in just a few letters of the alphabet, a whole life.
00:30:15.960; Now we digitize everything.
00:30:17.960; Every time you sneeze, you digitize it.
00:30:20.320; You put it on the internet.
00:30:22.800; And so I think that we are gonna digitize ourselves
00:30:25.440; and give us digital immortality.
00:30:28.000; We'll not only have biologic genetic immortality
00:30:31.280; of some sort, but also digital immortality.
00:30:34.880; And what are we gonna do with it?
00:30:37.080; I think we should send it into outer space.
00:30:40.880; If you digitize the human brain
00:30:43.080; and put it on a laser beam and shoot it to the moon,
00:30:46.600; you're on the moon in one second.
00:30:48.840; Shoot it to Mars, you're on Mars in 20 minutes.
00:30:51.960; Shoot it to Pluto, you're on Pluto in eight hours.
00:30:54.800; Think about it for a moment.
00:30:56.160; You can have breakfast in New York
00:30:58.480; and for a morning snack, vacation on the moon,
00:31:02.000; then zap your way to Mars by noontime,
00:31:05.560; journey through the asteroid belt of the afternoon,
00:31:08.520; and then come back for dinner in New York at night.
00:31:11.960; All in a day's work at the speed of light.
00:31:16.120; Now, this means that you don't need booster rockets.
00:31:19.680; You don't need weightlessness problems.
00:31:21.720; You don't need to worry about meteorites.
00:31:23.760; And what's on the moon?
00:31:25.320; On the moon, there is a mainframe
00:31:27.360; that downloads your laser beam's information.
00:31:31.080; And where does it download the information into?
00:31:34.000; An avatar.
00:31:35.760; Now, what does that avatar look like?
00:31:37.800; Anything you want.
00:31:40.960; Think about it for a moment.
00:31:41.920; You could be Superman, Superwoman, on the moon, on Mars,
00:31:47.400; traveling throughout the universe at the speed of light,
00:31:50.840; downloading your personality into any vehicle you want.
00:31:55.240; Now, let me stick my neck out.
00:31:57.200; So far, everything I've been saying
00:31:58.960; is well within the laws of physics.
00:32:00.800; Well within the laws of physics.
00:32:02.480; Now, let me go outside the laws of physics again.
00:32:04.760; Here we go.
00:32:05.920; I think this already exists.
00:32:08.840; I think outside the Earth, there could be a super highway
00:32:11.880; a laser highway of laser porting
00:32:14.760; with billions of souls of aliens
00:32:17.560; zapping their way across the galaxy.
00:32:20.880; Now, let me ask you a question.
00:32:22.680; Are we smart enough to determine
00:32:25.280; whether such a thing exists or not?
00:32:28.280; No, this could exist right outside
00:32:31.200; the orbit of the planet Earth.
00:32:32.960; And we're too stupid in our technology
00:32:35.680; to even prove it or disprove it.
00:32:38.760; We would need the aliens on this laser super highway
00:32:43.520; to help us out, to send us a human interpretable signal.
00:32:50.640; I mean, it ultimately boils down
00:32:51.920; to the language of communication,
00:32:53.320; but that's an exciting possibility
00:32:55.000; that actually the sky is filled with aliens.
00:32:59.080; The aliens could already be here.
00:33:00.760; And we're just so oblivious that we're too stupid to know it.
00:33:05.360; See, they don't have to be in alien form
00:33:07.280; with little green men.
00:33:09.720; They can be in any form they want
00:33:11.480; in an avatar of their creation.
00:33:13.280; Well, in fact, they could very well be.
00:33:16.240; They can even look like us.
00:33:17.320; Exactly.
00:33:18.160; We'd never know.
00:33:19.000; One of us could be an alien.
00:33:21.240; You know, in the zoo, did you know
00:33:22.720; that we sometimes have zookeepers that imitate animals?
00:33:26.360; We create a fake animal and we put it in
00:33:29.240; so that the animal is not afraid of this fake animal.
00:33:33.480; And of course, these animals brains,
00:33:35.080; their brain is about as big as a walnut.
00:33:37.080; They accept these dummies as if they were real.
00:33:41.680; So an alien civilization in outer space would say,
00:33:44.160; oh yeah, human brains are so tiny.
00:33:46.480; We could put a dummy on their world, an avatar,
00:33:49.240; and they'd never know it.
00:33:51.680; That would be an entertaining thing to watch
00:33:53.400; from the alien perspective.
00:33:55.040; So you kind of implied that with a digital form
00:33:58.880; of our being, but also biologically,
00:34:02.280; do you think one day technology will allow
00:34:04.560; individual human beings to become immortal
00:34:07.600; besides just through the ability to digitize our essence?
00:34:11.560; Yeah, I think that artificial intelligence
00:34:13.640; will give us the key to genetic immortality.
00:34:17.160; You see, in the coming decades,
00:34:18.880; everyone's gonna have their gene sequence.
00:34:21.280; We'll have billions of genomes of old people,
00:34:24.160; billions of genomes of young people.
00:34:26.760; And what are we gonna do with it?
00:34:28.200; We're gonna run it through an AI machine,
00:34:30.120; which has pattern recognition, to look for the age genes.
00:34:35.080; In other words, the fountain of youth that emperors,
00:34:38.480; kings, and queens lusted over.
00:34:41.920; The fountain of youth will be found
00:34:44.040; by artificial intelligence.
00:34:46.160; Artificial intelligence will identify
00:34:48.800; where these age genes are located.
00:34:52.200; First of all, what is aging?
00:34:53.800; We now know what aging is.
00:34:55.840; Aging is the buildup of errors.
00:34:59.680; That's all aging is, the buildup of genetic errors.
00:35:03.560; This means that cells eventually become slower, sluggish,
00:35:07.360; they go into senescence, and they die.
00:35:10.480; In fact, that's why we die.
00:35:13.720; We die because of the buildup of mistakes
00:35:16.840; in our genome, in our cellular activity.
00:35:20.720; But you see, in the future, we'll be able to fix those genes
00:35:23.120; with CRISPR type technologies,
00:35:25.440; and perhaps even live forever.
00:35:27.400; So let me ask you a question.
00:35:29.160; Where does aging take place in a car?
00:35:32.120; Given a car, where does aging take place?
00:35:34.640; Well, it's obvious, the engine, right?
00:35:37.520; A, that's where you have a lot of moving parts.
00:35:39.960; B, that's where you have combustion.
00:35:41.760; Well, where in the cell do we have combustion?
00:35:47.160; The mitochondria.
00:35:48.760; We now know where aging takes place.
00:35:52.000; And if we cure many of the mistakes that build up
00:35:55.000; in the mitochondria of the cell, we could become immortal.
00:35:59.360; Let me ask you, if you yourself could become immortal,
00:36:03.400; would you?
00:36:06.280; Damn straight.
00:36:07.120; No, I think about it for a while,
00:36:10.280; because of course, it depends on how you become immortal.
00:36:14.880; You know, there's a famous myth of Tithonus.
00:36:17.560; It turns out that years ago, in the Greek mythology,
00:36:21.640; there was the saga of Tithonus and Aurora.
00:36:25.280; Aurora was the goddess of the dawn,
00:36:28.360; and she fell in love with a mortal, a human called Tithonus.
00:36:32.120; And so Aurora begged Zeus to grant her
00:36:37.440; the gift of immortality to give to her lover.
00:36:42.240; So Zeus took pity on Aurora and made Tithonus immortal.
00:36:47.080; But you see, Aurora made a mistake,
00:36:49.600; a huge mistake.
00:36:52.440; She asked for immortality,
00:36:54.800; but she forgot to ask for eternal youth.
00:36:59.160; So poor Tithonus got older and older and older every year,
00:37:03.520; decrepit, a bag of bones, but he could never die.
00:37:08.600; Never die.
00:37:09.440; Quality of life is important.
00:37:11.600; So I think immortality is a great idea,
00:37:14.640; as long as you also have immortal youth as well.
00:37:18.120; Now, I personally believe, and I cannot prove this,
00:37:20.800; but I personally believe that our grandkids
00:37:22.680; may have the option of reaching the age of 30
00:37:26.200; and then stopping.
00:37:28.240; They may like being age 30,
00:37:30.880; because you have wisdom,
00:37:32.400; you have all the benefits of age and maturity,
00:37:35.720; and you still live forever with a healthy body.
00:37:39.280; Our descendants may like being 30 for several centuries.
00:37:43.240; Is there an aspect of human existence
00:37:45.280; that is meaningful only because we're mortal?
00:37:49.520; Well, every waking moment,
00:37:52.120; we don't think about it this way,
00:37:53.880; but every waking moment,
00:37:55.200; actually, we are aware of our death and our mortality.
00:38:00.240; Think about it for a moment.
00:38:01.280; When you go to college,
00:38:03.320; you realize that you are in a period of time
00:38:05.880; where soon you will reach middle age and have a career.
00:38:10.320; And after that, you'll retire and then you'll die.
00:38:13.840; And so even as a youth, even as a child,
00:38:17.280; without even thinking about it,
00:38:19.560; you are aware of your own death,
00:38:21.840; because it sets limits to your lifespan.
00:38:24.680; I gotta graduate from high school.
00:38:26.240; I gotta graduate from college.
00:38:27.840; Why?
00:38:28.880; Because you're gonna die.
00:38:30.320; Because unless you graduate from high school,
00:38:32.920; unless you graduate from college,
00:38:34.640; you're not gonna enter old age with enough money
00:38:37.280; to retire and then die.
00:38:39.480; And so, yeah, people think about it unconsciously,
00:38:42.640; because it affects every aspect of your being.
00:38:46.920; The fact that you go to high school, college,
00:38:49.240; get married, have kids, there's a clock,
00:38:52.240; a clock ticking even without your permission.
00:38:56.600; It gives a sense of urgency.
00:38:58.160; Do you yourself, I mean,
00:39:01.040; there's so much excitement and passion
00:39:03.000; in the way you talk about physics
00:39:04.520; and the way you talk about technology in the future.
00:39:07.960; Do you yourself meditate on your own mortality?
00:39:11.400; Do you think about this clock that's ticking?
00:39:14.600; Well, I try not to,
00:39:15.800; because it then begins to affect your behavior.
00:39:19.600; You begin to alter your behavior
00:39:21.960; to match your expectation of when you're gonna die.
00:39:26.280; So let's talk about youth,
00:39:27.880; and then let's talk about death, okay?
00:39:31.040; When I interview scientists on radio,
00:39:34.840; I often ask them, what made the difference?
00:39:37.960; How old were you?
00:39:39.400; What changed your life?
00:39:41.920; And they always say more or less the same thing.
00:39:44.080; No, these are Nobel Prize winners,
00:39:45.600; directors of major laboratories,
00:39:47.040; very distinguished scientists.
00:39:48.800; They always say, when I was 10,
00:39:52.960; when I was 10, something happened.
00:39:55.480; It was a visit to the planetarium.
00:39:57.720; It was a telescope.
00:39:59.400; For Steven Weinberg, winner of the Nobel Prize,
00:40:01.920; it was the chemistry kit.
00:40:03.840; For Heinz Pagels, it was a visit to the planetarium.
00:40:07.240; For Isidor Rabi, it was a book about the planets.
00:40:10.880; For Albert Einstein, it was a compass.
00:40:14.120; Something happened,
00:40:15.560; which gives them this existential shock.
00:40:18.840; Because you see, before the age of 10,
00:40:20.440; everything is mommy and daddy, mommy and dad.
00:40:22.520; That's your universe, mommy and daddy.
00:40:25.000; Around the age of 10, you begin to wonder,
00:40:27.480; what's beyond mommy and daddy?
00:40:30.680; And that's when you have this epiphany,
00:40:33.560; when you realize, oh my God, there's a universe out there,
00:40:38.880; a universe of discovery.
00:40:40.360; And that sensation stays with you for the rest of your life.
00:40:45.520; You still remember that shock
00:40:47.880; that you felt gazing at the universe.
00:40:50.800; And then you hit the greatest destroyer of scientists
00:40:55.440; known to science.
00:40:57.560; The greatest destroyer of scientists known to science
00:41:02.480; is junior high school.
00:41:05.560; When you hit junior high school, folks, it's all over.
00:41:08.840; It's all over.
00:41:10.720; Because in junior high school, people say, hey, stupid.
00:41:14.640; I mean, you like that nerdy stuff.
00:41:17.600; And your friends shun you.
00:41:19.800; All of a sudden, people think you're a weirdo.
00:41:22.560; And scientists made boring.
00:41:25.640; Richard Feynman, the Nobel Prize winner,
00:41:27.440; when he was a child,
00:41:29.000; his father would take him into the forest.
00:41:31.520; And the father would teach him everything about birds,
00:41:35.080; why they're shaped the way they are,
00:41:36.960; their wings, the coloration, the shape of their beak,
00:41:40.520; everything about birds.
00:41:43.080; So one day, a bully comes up
00:41:44.440; to the future Nobel Prize winner and says,
00:41:47.000; hey, Dick, what's the name of that bird over there?
00:41:51.360; Well, he didn't know.
00:41:53.040; He knew everything about that bird except its name.
00:41:58.760; So he said, I don't know.
00:42:00.960; And then the bully said, what's the matter, Dick?
00:42:03.080; You stupid or something?
00:42:05.200; And then in that instant, he got it.
00:42:08.720; He got it.
00:42:09.960; He realized that for most people,
00:42:12.040; science is giving names to birds.
00:42:15.960; That's what science is.
00:42:17.480; You know lots of names of obscure things.
00:42:19.800; Hey, people say, you're smart.
00:42:21.720; You're smart.
00:42:22.800; You know all the names of the dinosaurs.
00:42:24.640; You know all the names of the plants.
00:42:26.560; No, that's not science at all.
00:42:29.880; Science is about principles, concepts, physical pictures.
00:42:36.440; That's what science is all about.
00:42:38.560; My favorite quote from Einstein is that,
00:42:41.600; unless you can explain the theory to a child,
00:42:44.720; the theory is probably worthless.
00:42:47.800; Meaning that all great theories are not big words.
00:42:52.720; All great theories are simple concepts, principles,
00:42:57.520; basic physical pictures.
00:43:00.440; Relativity is all about clocks, meter sticks,
00:43:04.480; rocket ships and locomotives.
00:43:07.160; Newton's laws of gravity are all about balls
00:43:10.040; and spinning wheels and things like that.
00:43:13.160; That's what physics and science is all about,
00:43:15.760; not memorizing things.
00:43:17.480; And that stays with you for the rest of your life.
00:43:20.840; So even in old age, I've noticed that these scientists,
00:43:24.600; when they sit back, they still remember.
00:43:28.000; They still remember that flush,
00:43:30.480; that flush of excitement they felt with that first telescope,
00:43:34.880; that first moment when they encountered the universe.
00:43:38.640; That keeps them going.
00:43:40.040; That keeps them going.
00:43:42.800; By the way, I should point out that when I was eight,
00:43:46.200; something happened to me as well.
00:43:49.240; When I was eight years old, it was in all the papers
00:43:53.680; that a great scientist had just died.
00:43:56.720; And they put a picture of his desk on the front page.
00:44:00.760; That's it, just a simple picture of the front page
00:44:03.920; of the newspapers of his desk.
00:44:06.200; That desk had a book on it, which was opened.
00:44:09.120; And the caption said more or less,
00:44:11.400; this is the unfinished manuscript
00:44:14.200; from the greatest scientists of our time.
00:44:17.520; So I said to myself, well, why couldn't he finish it?
00:44:22.160; What's so hard that you can't finish it
00:44:25.720; if you're a great scientist?
00:44:26.840; It's a homework problem, right?
00:44:28.880; You go home, you solve it, or you ask your mom,
00:44:32.000; why couldn't he solve it?
00:44:33.680; So to me, this was a murder mystery.
00:44:35.520; This was greater than any adventure story.
00:44:37.800; I had to know why the greatest scientists of our time
00:44:41.000; couldn't finish something.
00:44:43.160; And then over the years, I found out the guy had a name,
00:44:46.480; Albert Einstein, and that book was The Theory of Everything.
00:44:51.480; It was unfinished.
00:44:53.080; Well, today I can read that book.
00:44:55.760; I can see all the dead ends and false starts that he made.
00:44:59.320; And I began to realize that he lost his way
00:45:02.120; because he didn't have a physical picture
00:45:05.920; to guide him on the third try.
00:45:09.400; On the first try, he talked about clocks
00:45:12.560; and lightning bolts and meter sticks,
00:45:15.040; and that gave us special relativity,
00:45:17.280; which gave us the atomic bomb.
00:45:19.840; The second great picture was gravity
00:45:23.040; with balls rolling on curved surfaces.
00:45:26.320; And that gave us the Big Bang,
00:45:28.200; creation of the universe, black holes.
00:45:30.960; On the third try, he missed it.
00:45:34.200; He had no picture at all to guide him.
00:45:38.120; In fact, there's a quote I have where he said,
00:45:40.160; I'm still looking.
00:45:41.600; I'm still looking for that picture.
00:45:44.280; He never found it.
00:45:45.800; Well, today we think that picture is strength theory.
00:45:49.320; The strength theory can unify gravity
00:45:52.240; and this mysterious thing that Einstein didn't like,
00:45:54.720; which is quantum mechanics,
00:45:55.840; or couldn't quite pin down and make sense of.
00:45:59.240; That's right.
00:46:00.080; Mother nature has two hands, a left hand and a right hand.
00:46:02.880; The left hand is a theory of the small.
00:46:05.200; The right hand is a theory of the big.
00:46:07.720; The theory of the small is the quantum theory,
00:46:09.880; the theory of atoms and quarks.
00:46:11.920; The theory of the big is relativity,
00:46:13.960; the theory of black holes, big bangs.
00:46:16.360; The problem is the left hand does not talk to the right hand.
00:46:22.600; They hate each other.
00:46:24.520; The left hand is based on discrete particles.
00:46:27.400; The right hand is based on smooth surfaces.
00:46:31.080; How do you put these two things together
00:46:33.240; into a single theory?
00:46:34.280; They hate each other.
00:46:35.880; The greatest minds of our time,
00:46:38.200; the greatest minds of our time
00:46:40.200; worked on this problem and failed.
00:46:43.280; Today, the only theory that has survived
00:46:46.720; every challenge so far is string theory.
00:46:49.520; That doesn't mean string theory is correct.
00:46:51.600; It could very well be wrong,
00:46:53.360; but right now it's the only game in town.
00:46:56.240; Some people come up to me and say,
00:46:57.760; ''Professor, I don't believe in string theory.
00:47:00.240; Give me an alternative.''
00:47:02.720; And I tell them there is none.
00:47:05.760; Get used to it.
00:47:07.760; It's the best theory we got.
00:47:09.360; It's the only theory we have.
00:47:10.880; It's the only theory we have.
00:47:13.080; Do you see, you know,
00:47:16.000; the strings kind of inspire a view,
00:47:20.160; as did atoms and particles and quarks,
00:47:23.120; but especially strings inspire a view of a universe
00:47:26.720; as a kind of information processing system,
00:47:29.000; as a computer of sorts.
00:47:31.560; Do you see the universe in this way?
00:47:33.680; No.
00:47:34.960; Some people think, in fact,
00:47:36.320; the whole universe is a computer of some sort.
00:47:39.840; And they believe that perhaps everything,
00:47:42.600; therefore, is a simulation.
00:47:44.040; Yes.
00:47:45.040; I don't think so.
00:47:46.360; I don't think that there is a super video game
00:47:49.320; where we are nothing but puppets dancing on the screen
00:47:52.680; and somebody hit the play button
00:47:54.480; and here we are talking about simulations.
00:47:57.560; No.
00:47:58.480; Even Newtonian mechanics says that the weather,
00:48:02.760; the simple weather is so complicated
00:48:04.840; with trillions upon trillions of atoms
00:48:07.320; that it cannot be simulated in a finite amount of time.
00:48:10.840; In other words, the smallest object
00:48:13.880; which can describe the weather
00:48:17.280; and simulate the weather is the weather itself.
00:48:21.360; The smallest object that can simulate a human
00:48:24.360; is the human itself.
00:48:26.960; And if you had quantum mechanics,
00:48:28.840; it becomes almost impossible
00:48:31.360; to simulate it with a conventional computer.
00:48:34.800; This quantum mechanics deals with all possible universes,
00:48:38.600; parallel universes, a multiverse of universes.
00:48:42.440; And so the calculation just spirals out of control.
00:48:46.640; Now, so far, there's only one way
00:48:49.760; where you might be able to argue
00:48:52.320; that the universe is a simulation.
00:48:54.160; And this is still being debated by quantum physicists.
00:48:58.320; It turns out that if you throw the encyclopedia
00:49:00.520; into a black hole, the information is not lost.
00:49:04.000; Eventually it winds up on the surface of the black hole.
00:49:07.600; Now, the surface of the black hole is finite.
00:49:09.960; In fact, you can calculate
00:49:11.640; the maximum amount of information
00:49:13.520; you can store in a black hole.
00:49:15.640; It's a finite number.
00:49:17.160; It's a calculable number, believe it or not.
00:49:19.720; Now, if the universe were made out of black holes,
00:49:21.720; which is the maximum universe you can conceive of,
00:49:25.000; each universe, each black hole
00:49:27.160; has a finite amount of information.
00:49:29.640; Therefore, ergo, da da!
00:49:32.560; Ergo, the total amount of information in a universe
00:49:37.080; is finite.
00:49:38.880; This is mind boggling.
00:49:40.480; This, I consider mind boggling,
00:49:42.960; that all possible universes are countable
00:49:46.600; and all possible universes can be summarized in a number,
00:49:50.000; a number you can write on a sheet of paper,
00:49:52.040; all possible universes, and it's a finite number.
00:49:55.160; Now, it's huge.
00:49:56.600; It's a number beyond human imagination.
00:49:59.560; It's a number based on what is called a Planck length,
00:50:01.960; but it's a number.
00:50:03.680; And so if a computer could ever simulate that number,
00:50:07.560; then the universe would be a simulation.
00:50:10.080; So theoretically, because the amount of information
00:50:13.960; is finite, well, there necessarily must be able
00:50:18.520; to exist a computer.
00:50:19.880; It's just, from an engineering perspective,
00:50:21.840; maybe impossible to build.
00:50:24.080; Yes, no computer can build a universe
00:50:26.920; capable of simulating the entire universe,
00:50:29.280; except the universe itself.
00:50:31.000; So that's your intuition, that our universe
00:50:34.040; is very efficient, and so there's no shortcuts.
00:50:37.960; Right, two reasons why I believe the universe
00:50:40.040; is not a simulation.
00:50:41.320; First, the calculational numbers are just incredible.
00:50:44.480; No finite Turing machine can simulate the universe.
00:50:48.320; And second, why would any super intelligent being
00:50:52.120; simulate humans?
00:50:54.400; If you think about it, most humans are kind of stupid.
00:50:57.960; I mean, we do all sorts of crazy, stupid things, right?
00:51:01.040; And we call it art, we call it humor.
00:51:03.880; We call it human civilization.
00:51:06.280; So why should an advanced civilization
00:51:08.800; go through all that effort just to simulate Saturday Night
00:51:12.680; Live?
00:51:14.280; Well, that's a funny idea, but it's also,
00:51:16.400; do you think it's possible that the act of creation
00:51:20.200; cannot anticipate humans?
00:51:22.080; You simply set the initial conditions
00:51:23.760; and set a bunch of physical laws,
00:51:26.000; and just for the fun of it, see what happens.
00:51:28.760; You launch the thing, so you're not necessarily
00:51:30.720; simulating everything.
00:51:31.680; You're not simulating every little bit in the sense
00:51:35.320; that you could predict what's going to happen,
00:51:37.720; but you set the initial conditions, set the laws,
00:51:40.960; and see what kind of fun stuff happens.
00:51:43.200; Well, in some sense, that's how life got started.
00:51:46.960; In the 1950s, Stanley did what is called
00:51:50.120; the Miller experiment.
00:51:51.800; He put a bunch of hydrogen gas, methane, toxic gases
00:51:57.800; with liquid and a spark in a small glass beaker.
00:52:02.400; And then he just walked away for a few weeks,
00:52:05.080; came back a few weeks later, and bingo.
00:52:08.480; Out of nothing and chaos came amino acids.
00:52:12.840; If he had left it there for a few years,
00:52:14.960; he might have gotten protein, protein molecules for free.
00:52:19.200; That's probably how life got started, as a accident.
00:52:23.720; And if he had left it there for perhaps a few million years,
00:52:26.960; DNA might have formed in that beaker.
00:52:30.840; And so we think that, yeah, DNA, life, all that
00:52:34.080; could have been an accident if you wait long enough.
00:52:38.480; And remember, our universe is roughly 13.8 billion years old.
00:52:42.560; That's plenty of time for lots of random things
00:52:45.600; to happen, including life itself.
00:52:51.360; Yeah, we could be just a beautiful little random moment.
00:52:56.920; And there could be an infinite number
00:52:59.120; of those throughout the history of the universe,
00:53:02.320; many creatures like us.
00:53:04.640; We perhaps are not the epitome of what
00:53:06.480; the universe is created for.
00:53:07.960; Thank God.
00:53:09.880; Let's hope not.
00:53:11.600; Just look around.
00:53:12.440; Yeah.
00:53:13.640; Look to your left, look to your right.
00:53:16.160; When do you think the first human will step foot on Mars?
00:53:20.400; I think it's a good chance in the 2030s
00:53:23.360; that we will be on Mars.
00:53:25.280; In fact, there's no physics reason why we can't do it.
00:53:29.480; It's an engineering problem.
00:53:31.320; It's a very difficult and dangerous engineering problem,
00:53:34.480; but it is an engineering problem.
00:53:36.600; And in my book, Future of Humanity,
00:53:38.640; I even speculate beyond that, that by the end
00:53:41.880; of this century, we'll probably have the first starships.
00:53:45.720; The first starships will not look
00:53:47.360; like the Enterprise at all.
00:53:49.080; They'll probably be small computer chips
00:53:51.680; that are fired by laser beams with parachutes.
00:53:54.760; And like what Stephen Hawking advocated,
00:53:58.400; the Breakthrough Starshot program
00:54:00.160; could send ships to the nearby stars,
00:54:02.920; traveling at 20% the speed of light,
00:54:05.400; reaching Alpha Centauri in about 20 years time.
00:54:09.080; Beyond that, we should have fusion power.
00:54:12.880; Fusion power is, in some sense, one
00:54:15.880; of the ultimate sources of energy, but it's unstable.
00:54:19.720; And we don't have fusion power today.
00:54:22.600; Now, why is that?
00:54:23.720; First of all, stars form almost for free.
00:54:26.160; You get a bunch of gas large enough, it becomes a star.
00:54:29.560; I mean, you don't even have to do anything to it,
00:54:31.920; and it becomes a star.
00:54:33.480; Why is fusion so difficult to put on the Earth?
00:54:37.440; Because in outer space, stars are monopoles.
00:54:40.120; They are pole, single poles that are spherically symmetric.
00:54:44.880; And it's very easy to get spherically symmetric
00:54:47.400; configurations of gas to compress into a star.
00:54:51.160; It just happens naturally all by itself.
00:54:53.800; The problem is magnetism is bipolar.
00:54:56.800; You have a North Pole and a South Pole.
00:54:59.200; And it's like trying to squeeze a long balloon.
00:55:02.320; Take a long balloon and try to squeeze it.
00:55:04.960; You squeeze one side, it bulges out the other side.
00:55:08.240; Well, that's the problem with fusion machines.
00:55:10.560; We use magnetism with a North Pole and a South Pole
00:55:13.440; to squeeze gas, and all sorts of anomalies
00:55:17.560; and horrible configurations can take place
00:55:20.240; because we're not squeezing something uniformly
00:55:23.440; like in a star.
00:55:24.920; Stars, in some sense, are for free.
00:55:27.200; Fusion on the Earth is very difficult.
00:55:31.120; But I think it's inevitable.
00:55:32.960; And it'll eventually give us unlimited power from seawater.
00:55:37.000; So seawater will be the ultimate source of energy
00:55:39.880; for the planet Earth.
00:55:41.160; Why?
00:55:41.680; What's the intuition there?
00:55:42.760; Because we'll extract hydrogen from seawater,
00:55:45.440; burn hydrogen in a fusion reactor
00:55:47.760; to give us unlimited energy without the meltdown,
00:55:52.200; without the nuclear waste.
00:55:53.960; Why do we have meltdowns?
00:55:55.680; We have meltdowns because in the fusion reactors,
00:55:57.920; every time you split the uranium atom, you get nuclear waste.
00:56:00.760; Tons of it.
00:56:01.720; 30 tons of nuclear waste per reactor per year.
00:56:07.080; And it's hot.
00:56:08.400; It's hot for thousands, millions of years.
00:56:11.200; That's why we have meltdowns.
00:56:13.200; But you see, the waste product of a fusion reactor
00:56:15.680; is helium gas.
00:56:17.480; Helium gas is actually commercially valuable.
00:56:19.880; You can make money selling helium gas.
00:56:22.320; And so the waste product of a fusion reactor
00:56:24.960; is helium, not nuclear waste that we find
00:56:28.600; in a commercial fission plant.
00:56:30.720; And that controlling, mastering and controlling fusion
00:56:34.240; allows us to, converts us into a type one,
00:56:38.320; I guess, civilization, right?
00:56:40.200; Yeah, probably the backbone of a type one civilization
00:56:43.280; will be fusion power.
00:56:45.720; We, by the way, are type zero.
00:56:47.760; We don't even rate on this scale.
00:56:49.600; We get our energy from dead plants, for God's sake,
00:56:52.080; oil and coal.
00:56:53.560; But we are about 100 years from being type one.
00:56:56.320; Get a calculator.
00:56:57.680; In fact, Carl Sagan calculated that we
00:56:59.960; are about 0.7, fairly close to a 1.0.
00:57:05.640; For example, what is the internet?
00:57:08.720; The internet is the beginning of the first type one technology
00:57:12.280; to enter into our century.
00:57:14.080; The first planetary technology is the internet.
00:57:17.400; What is the language of type one?
00:57:19.840; On the internet already, English and Mandarin Chinese
00:57:23.400; are the most dominant languages on the internet.
00:57:26.880; And what about the culture?
00:57:29.360; We're seeing a type one sports, soccer, the Olympics,
00:57:34.560; a type one music, youth culture, rock and roll, rap music,
00:57:38.920; type one fashion, Gucci, Chanel, a type one economy,
00:57:42.920; the European Union, NAFTA, what have you.
00:57:45.600; So we're beginning to see the beginnings of a type one
00:57:49.280; culture in a type one civilization.
00:57:52.200; And inevitably, it will spread beyond this planet.
00:57:56.000; So you talked about sending at 20% the speed of light
00:58:00.680; on a chip into Alpha Centauri.
00:58:04.800; But in a slightly nearer term, what
00:58:07.960; do you think about the idea when we still have to send
00:58:11.120; our biological bodies the colonization of planets,
00:58:15.240; colonization of Mars?
00:58:16.560; Do you see us becoming a two planet species ever
00:58:21.360; or anytime soon?
00:58:23.120; Well, just remember the dinosaurs
00:58:26.320; did not have a space program.
00:58:28.760; And that's why they're not here today.
00:58:30.440; How come there are no dinosaurs in this room today?
00:58:33.640; Because they didn't have a space program.
00:58:35.920; We do have a space program, which
00:58:38.320; means that we have an insurance policy.
00:58:40.760; Now, I don't think we should bankrupt the Earth
00:58:43.080; or deplete the Earth to go to Mars.
00:58:44.840; That's too expensive and not practical.
00:58:47.360; But we need a settlement, a settlement on Mars
00:58:50.560; in case something bad happens to the planet Earth.
00:58:53.640; And that means we have to terraform Mars.
00:58:56.400; Now, to terraform Mars, if we could
00:58:58.600; raise the temperature of Mars by six degrees, six degrees,
00:59:03.600; then the polar ice caps begin to melt, releasing water vapor.
00:59:08.480; Water vapor is a greenhouse gas.
00:59:10.600; It causes even more melting of the ice caps.
00:59:13.400; So it becomes a self fulfilling prophecy.
00:59:17.120; It feeds on itself.
00:59:18.880; It becomes autocatalytic.
00:59:21.240; And so once you hit six degrees, rising
00:59:24.040; of the temperature on Mars by six degrees, it takes off.
00:59:27.200; And we melt the polar ice caps.
00:59:29.280; And liquid water once again flows
00:59:32.600; in the rivers, the canals, the channels,
00:59:35.840; and the oceans of Mars.
00:59:38.440; Mars once had an ocean, we think,
00:59:39.920; about the size of the United States.
00:59:42.080; And so that is a possibility.
00:59:44.320; Now, how do we get there?
00:59:46.040; How do we raise the temperature of Mars by six degrees?
00:59:49.040; Elon Musk would like to detonate hydrogen warheads
00:59:51.680; on the polar ice caps.
00:59:53.680; Well, I'm not sure about that.
00:59:56.880; Because we don't know that much about the effects
00:59:59.680; of detonating hydrogen warheads to melt the polar ice caps.
01:00:03.520; And who wants to glow in the dark at night reading
01:00:05.840; the newspaper?
01:00:07.240; So I think there are other ways to do it
01:00:09.560; with solar satellites.
01:00:12.000; You can have satellites orbiting Mars that beam sunlight
01:00:16.080; onto the polar ice caps, melting the polar ice caps.
01:00:19.480; Mars has plenty of water.
01:00:21.440; It's just frozen.
01:00:24.200; I think you paint an inspiring and a wonderful picture
01:00:27.880; of the future.
01:00:29.760; I think you've inspired and educated thousands,
01:00:35.120; if not millions.
01:00:36.240; Michio, it's been an honor.
01:00:37.400; Thank you so much for talking today.
01:00:39.000; My pleasure.
