00:00:00.000;The following is a conversation with Michio Kaku.
00:00:02.800;He's a theoretical physicist, futurist,
00:00:05.120;and professor at the City College of New York.
00:00:08.320;He's the author of many fascinating books
00:00:10.760;that explore the nature of our reality
00:00:12.840;and the future of our civilization.
00:00:15.520;They include Einstein's Cosmos, Physics of the Impossible,
00:00:19.200;Future of the Mind, Parallel Worlds,
00:00:21.600;and his latest, The Future of Humanity,
00:00:24.240;Terraforming Mars, Interstellar Travel,
00:00:26.640;Immortality, and Our Destiny Beyond Earth.
00:00:29.960;I think it's beautiful and important
00:00:32.960;when a scientific mind can fearlessly explore
00:00:35.780;through conversation subjects
00:00:37.600;just outside of our understanding.
00:00:40.220;That, to me, is where artificial intelligence is today,
00:00:43.440;just outside of our understanding,
00:00:45.680;a place we have to reach for
00:00:47.480;if we're to uncover the mysteries of the human mind
00:00:50.160;and build human-level and superhuman-level AI systems
00:00:53.900;that transform our world for the better.
00:00:56.660;This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.

00:01:06.680;Alex Friedman, spelled F-R-I-D-M-A-N.
00:01:09.960;And now, here's my conversation with Michio Kaku.
00:01:14.720;You've mentioned that we just might make contact
00:01:17.420;with aliens, or at least hear from them,
00:01:19.660;within this century.
00:01:21.780;Can you elaborate on your intuition behind that optimism?
00:01:25.920;Well, this is pure speculation, of course.
00:01:28.200;Of course.
00:01:29.800;I mean, given the fact that we've already identified
00:01:31.220;4,000 exoplanets orbiting other stars,
00:01:34.720;and we have a census of the Milky Way galaxy
00:01:37.540;for the first time,
00:01:39.160;we know that on average, every single star, on average,
00:01:43.540;has a planet going around it,
00:01:45.620;and about one-fifth or so of them
00:01:47.700;have Earth-sized planets going around them.
00:01:51.220;So just do the math.
00:01:52.960;We're talking about, out of 100 billion stars
00:01:56.140;in the Milky Way galaxy,
00:01:58.160;we're talking about billions
00:01:59.840;of potential Earth-sized planets.
00:02:02.920;And to believe that we're the only one
00:02:05.760;is, I think, rather ridiculous, given the odds.
00:02:09.160;And how many galaxies are there?
00:02:11.600;Within sight of the Hubble Space Telescope,
00:02:14.560;there are about 100 billion galaxies.
00:02:17.880;So do the math.
00:02:19.680;How many stars are there in the visible universe?
00:02:22.500;100 billion galaxies times 100 billion stars per galaxy.
00:02:29.080;We're talking about a number beyond human imagination.
00:02:33.760;And to believe that we're the only ones,
00:02:35.520;I think, is rather ridiculous.
00:02:38.240;So you've talked about different types of,
00:02:42.200;type 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, even,
00:02:44.840;of the Kardashian scale
00:02:47.200;of the different kind of civilizations.
00:02:50.440;What do you think it takes,
00:02:52.800;if it is indeed a ridiculous notion
00:02:54.640;that we're alone in the universe,
00:02:56.260;what do you think it takes to reach out,
00:02:58.780;first to reach out through communication and connect?
00:03:02.700;Well, first of all, we have to understand
00:03:04.380;the level of sophistication of an alien life form
00:03:08.780;if we make contact with them.
00:03:10.540;I think in this century, we'll probably pick up signals,
00:03:14.220;signals from an extraterrestrial civilization.
00:03:17.440;We'll pick up their I Love Lucy
00:03:19.300;and their Leave it to Beaver,
00:03:21.300;just ordinary day-to-day transmissions that they emit.
00:03:26.040;The first thing we want to do is to,
00:03:27.840;A, decipher their language, of course,
00:03:30.280;but B, figure out at what level
00:03:33.380;they are advanced on the Kardashev scale.
00:03:37.120;I'm a physicist.
00:03:38.600;We rank things by two parameters,
00:03:41.040;energy and information.
00:03:43.680;That's how we rank black holes.
00:03:45.640;That's how we rank stars.
00:03:47.360;That's how we rank civilizations in outer space.
00:03:50.640;So a type 1 civilization is capable
00:03:54.980;of harnessing planetary power.
00:03:57.580;They control the weather, for example,
00:04:00.020;earthquakes, volcanoes.
00:04:01.320;They can modify the course of geological events,
00:04:04.620;sort of like Flash Gordon or Buck Rogers.
00:04:08.440;Type 2 would be stellar.
00:04:12.280;They play with stars, entire stars.
00:04:15.660;They use the entire energy output of a star,
00:04:18.460;sort of like Star Trek.
00:04:20.600;The Federation of Planets have colonized the nearby stars.
00:04:25.420;So a type 2 would be somewhat similar to Star Trek.
00:04:29.100;Type 3 would be galactic.
00:04:30.700;They roam the galactic space lanes.
00:04:33.860;And type 3 would be like Star Wars,
00:04:37.740;a galactic civilization.
00:04:39.920;Now, one day I was giving this talk in London
00:04:42.380;at the planetarium there,
00:04:43.940;and the little boy comes up to me and he says,
00:04:46.040;"'Professor, you're wrong.
00:04:48.740;"'You're wrong.
00:04:49.580;"'There's type 4.'"
00:04:51.060;And I told him,
00:04:51.960;look, kid,
00:04:53.400;there are planets, stars, and galaxies.
00:04:57.040;That's it, folks.
00:04:58.760;And he kept persisting and saying,
00:05:00.840;"'No, there's type 4, the power of the continuum.'"
00:05:05.880;And I thought about it for a moment,
00:05:07.600;and I said to myself,
00:05:08.600;is there an extra galactic source of energy,
00:05:12.260;the continuum of Star Trek?
00:05:14.560;And the answer is yes.
00:05:16.300;There could be a type 4, and that's dark energy.
00:05:20.080;We now know that 73% of the energy of the universe
00:05:25.500;is dark energy.
00:05:27.620;Dark matter represents maybe 23% or so,
00:05:30.660;and we only represent 4%.
00:05:33.100;We're the oddballs.
00:05:34.660;And so you begin to realize that,
00:05:36.220;yeah, there could be type 4,
00:05:38.000;maybe even type 5.
00:05:39.780;So type 4, you're saying,
00:05:42.180;being able to harness sort of like dark energy,
00:05:45.400;something that permeates the entire universe.
00:05:47.200;So be able to plug into the entire universe
00:05:51.040;as a source of energy.
00:05:52.120;That's right.
00:05:52.960;And dark energy is the energy of the Big Bang.
00:05:55.720;It's why the galaxies are being pushed apart.
00:05:58.960;It's the energy of nothing.
00:06:00.760;The more nothing you have,
00:06:02.600;the more dark energy that's repulsive.
00:06:05.440;And so the acceleration of the universe is accelerating
00:06:09.000;because the more you have, the more you can have.
00:06:12.700;And that, of course,
00:06:13.540;is by definition an exponential curve.
00:06:15.820;It's called a de Sitter expansion,
00:06:17.760;and that's the current state of the universe.
00:06:20.500;And then type 5,
00:06:22.880;would that be able to seek energy sources
00:06:27.800;somehow outside of our universe?
00:06:31.080;And how crazy is that idea?
00:06:33.040;Yeah, type 5 would be the multiverse.
00:06:35.400;Multiverse, okay.
00:06:36.320;I'm a quantum physicist,
00:06:37.800;and we quantum physicists don't believe
00:06:40.320;that the Big Bang happened once.
00:06:42.180;That would violate the Heisenberg and Sergi principle.
00:06:45.160;And that means that there could be multiple bangs
00:06:47.900;happening all the time.
00:06:49.420;Even as we speak today, universes are being created.
00:06:54.380;That fits the data.
00:06:56.220;The inflationary universe is a quantum theory.
00:07:00.020;So there's a certain finite probability
00:07:02.100;that universes are being created all the time.
00:07:05.180;And for me, this is actually rather aesthetically pleasing
00:07:08.780;because, you know, I was raised as a Presbyterian,
00:07:13.280;but my parents were Buddhists.
00:07:15.960;And there's two diametrically opposed ideas
00:07:19.560;about the universe.
00:07:21.120;In Buddhism, there's only nirvana.
00:07:23.280;There's no beginning.
00:07:24.400;There's no end.
00:07:25.240;There's only timelessness.
00:07:26.960;But in Christianity, there is the instant
00:07:30.000;when God said, let there be light.
00:07:32.800;In other words, an instant of creation.
00:07:35.360;So I've had these two mutually exclusive ideas in my head.
00:07:40.320;And I now realize that it's possible
00:07:41.920;to meld them into a single theory.
00:07:45.140;Either the universe had a beginning or it didn't, right?
00:07:48.660;Wrong.
00:07:49.900;You see, our universe had a beginning.
00:07:53.180;Our universe had an instant where somebody might have said,
00:07:56.260;let there be light.
00:07:57.900;But there are other bubble universes out there
00:08:00.380;in a bubble bath of universes.
00:08:02.780;And that means that these universes are expanding
00:08:07.300;into a dimension beyond
00:08:09.100;our three-dimensional comprehension.
00:08:11.280;In other words, hyperspace.
00:08:13.120;In other words, 11-dimensional hyperspace.
00:08:16.400;So nirvana would be this timeless,
00:08:19.520;11-dimensional hyperspace where big bangs
00:08:23.040;are happening all the time.
00:08:24.900;So we can now combine two mutually exclusive theories
00:08:28.680;of creation.
00:08:30.960;And Stephen Hawking, for example,
00:08:32.680;even in his last book,
00:08:35.360;even said that this is an argument
00:08:37.160;against the existence of God.
00:08:39.500;He said there is no God because there was not enough time
00:08:42.660;for God to create the universe
00:08:44.300;because the big bang happened in an instant of time.
00:08:47.820;Therefore, there was no time available
00:08:50.380;for him to create the universe.
00:08:52.340;But you see, the multiverse idea means
00:08:55.020;that there was a time before time.
00:08:58.180;And there are multiple times.
00:08:59.580;Each bubble has its own time.
00:09:02.100;And so it means that there could actually be a universe
00:09:06.240;before the beginning of our universe.
00:09:09.640;So if you think of a bubble bath,
00:09:11.120;when two bubbles collide,
00:09:13.640;or when two bubbles fission to create a baby bubble,
00:09:16.800;that's called the big bang.
00:09:18.800;So the big bang is nothing but the collision of universes
00:09:21.520;or the budding of universes.
00:09:23.720;That's such a beautiful picture
00:09:25.080;of our incredibly mysterious existence.
00:09:28.000;So is that humbling to you,
00:09:30.240;exciting, the idea of multiverses?
00:09:32.840;I don't even know how to even begin
00:09:35.820;to wrap my mind around it.
00:09:37.660;It's exciting for me
00:09:38.500;because what I do for a living is string theory.
00:09:41.700;That's my day job.
00:09:43.060;I get paid by the city of New York to work on string theory.
00:09:46.860;And you see, string theory is a multiverse theory.
00:09:50.540;So people say, first of all, what is string theory?
00:09:53.420;String theory simply says
00:09:54.740;that all the particles we see in nature,
00:09:56.740;the electron, the proton, the quarks, what have you,
00:09:59.860;are nothing but vibrations on a musical string,
00:10:03.260;on a tiny, tiny little string.
00:10:05.940;You know, G. Robert Oppenheimer,
00:10:07.420;the creator of the atomic bomb,
00:10:09.660;was so frustrated in the 1950s
00:10:12.060;with all these subatomic particles being created
00:10:15.220;in our atom smashers that he announced,
00:10:18.260;he announced one day that the Nobel Prize in physics
00:10:22.740;should go to the physicist
00:10:23.980;who does not discover a new particle that year.
00:10:28.300;Well, today we think they're nothing but musical notes
00:10:30.620;on these tiny little vibrating strings.
00:10:33.720;So what is physics?
00:10:34.760;Physics is the harmonies you can write
00:10:36.840;on vibrating strings.
00:10:38.640;What is chemistry?
00:10:40.200;Chemistry is the melodies you can play on these strings.
00:10:44.900;What is the universe?
00:10:47.080;The universe is a symphony of strings.
00:10:50.440;And then what is the mind of God
00:10:53.240;that Albert Einstein so eloquently wrote about
00:10:55.760;for the last 30 years of his life?
00:10:58.440;The mind of God would be cosmic music,
00:11:03.500;resonating through 11 dimensional hyperspace.
00:11:06.180;So beautifully put.
00:11:07.300;What do you think is the mind of Einstein's God?
00:11:11.900;Do you think there's a why that we could untangle
00:11:16.140;from this universe of strings?
00:11:19.780;Why are we here?
00:11:20.920;What is the meaning of it all?
00:11:23.340;Well, Steven Weinberg, winner of the Nobel Prize,
00:11:26.300;once said that the more we learn about the universe,
00:11:29.780;the more we learn that it's pointless.
00:11:33.740;Well, I don't know.
00:11:35.620;I don't profess to understand
00:11:37.340;the great secrets of the universe.
00:11:39.340;However, let me say two things
00:11:41.180;about what the giants of physics
00:11:43.340;have said about this question.
00:11:45.340;Einstein believed in two types of God.
00:11:49.340;One was the God of the Bible, the personal God,
00:11:54.300;the God that answers prayers, walks on waters,
00:11:56.580;performs miracles, smites the Philistines.
00:12:00.080;That's the personal God that he didn't believe in.
00:12:02.800;He believed in the God of Spinoza,
00:12:05.520;the God of order, simplicity, harmony, beauty.
00:12:10.080;The universe could have been ugly.
00:12:12.840;The universe could have been messy, random,
00:12:15.720;but it's gorgeous.
00:12:17.360;It relates on a single sheet of paper.
00:12:20.000;We can write down all the known laws of the universe.
00:12:23.120;It's amazing.
00:12:23.940;On one sheet of paper, Einstein's equation is one inch long.
00:12:27.840;String theory is a lot longer,
00:12:30.020;and so is the standard model,
00:12:31.980;but you could put all these equations on one sheet of paper.
00:12:36.860;It didn't have to be that way.
00:12:38.620;It could have been messy.
00:12:40.260;And so Einstein thought of himself as a young boy
00:12:43.160;entering this huge library for the first time,
00:12:47.500;being overwhelmed by the simplicity, elegance,
00:12:51.180;and beauty of this library,
00:12:53.140;but all he could do was read the first page
00:12:56.580;of the first volume.
00:12:58.320;Well, that library is the universe
00:13:00.320;with all sorts of mysterious, magical things
00:13:03.220;that we have yet to find.
00:13:05.280;And then Galileo was asked about this.
00:13:07.920;Galileo said that the purpose of science,
00:13:13.000;the purpose of science is to determine how the heavens go.
00:13:17.680;The purpose of religion is to determine how to go to heaven.
00:13:23.400;So in other words, science is about natural law,
00:13:27.420;and religion is about ethics,
00:13:30.580;how to be a good person, how to go to heaven.
00:13:33.380;As long as we keep these two things apart,
00:13:36.020;we're in great shape.
00:13:37.940;The problem occurs when people from the natural sciences
00:13:42.140;begin to pontificate about ethics,
00:13:44.380;and people from religion begin to pontificate
00:13:47.220;about natural law.
00:13:48.860;That's where we get into big trouble.
00:13:51.800;You think they're fundamentally distinct,
00:13:53.760;morality and ethics, and our idea of what is right
00:13:58.400;and what is wrong.
00:13:59.400;That's something that's outside the reach
00:14:02.120;of string theory and physics.
00:14:04.000;That's right.
00:14:04.840;If you talk to a squirrel about what is right
00:14:08.720;and what is wrong, there's no reference frame for a squirrel.
00:14:14.120;And realize that aliens from outer space,
00:14:16.620;if they ever come visit us,
00:14:19.180;they'll try to talk to us like we talk to squirrels
00:14:21.900;in the forest, but eventually we get bored
00:14:24.700;talking to the squirrels because they don't talk back to us.
00:14:28.060;Same thing with aliens from outer space.
00:14:30.020;They come down to earth, they'll be curious about us
00:14:32.300;to a degree, but after a while they just get bored
00:14:35.460;because we have nothing to offer them.
00:14:37.940;So our sense of right and wrong,
00:14:40.500;what does that mean compared to a squirrel's sense
00:14:43.420;of right and wrong?
00:14:46.600;Now we, of course, do have an ethics
00:14:48.720;that keeps civilizations in line, enriches our life,
00:14:53.920;and makes civilization possible.
00:14:56.480;And I think that's a good thing,
00:14:58.040;but it's not mandated by a law of physics.
00:15:01.560;So if aliens do, alien species were to make contact,
00:15:06.960;forgive me for staying on aliens for a bit longer,
00:15:10.920;do you think they're more likely to be friendly
00:15:16.580;to befriend us or to destroy us?
00:15:18.740;Well, I think for the most part,
00:15:20.620;they'll pretty much ignore us.
00:15:22.900;If you're a deer in the forest, who do you fear the most?
00:15:25.980;Do you fear the hunter with his gigantic 16 gauge shotgun?
00:15:30.540;Or do you fear the guy with a briefcase and glasses?
00:15:35.460;Well, the guy with a briefcase could be a developer
00:15:39.100;about to basically flatten the entire forest,
00:15:42.460;destroying your livelihood.
00:15:44.280;So instinctively, you may be afraid of the hunter,
00:15:47.800;but actually the problem with deers in the forest
00:15:51.400;is that they should fear developers
00:15:54.280;because developers look at deer
00:15:56.280;as simply getting in the way.
00:15:59.500;I mean, in War of the Worlds by H.G. Wells,
00:16:02.640;the aliens did not hate us.
00:16:04.840;If you read the book, the aliens did not have
00:16:07.960;evil intentions toward homo sapiens.
00:16:11.440;No, we were in the way.
00:16:14.960;So I think we have to realize that alien civilizations
00:16:19.120;may view us quite differently
00:16:20.520;than in science fiction novels.
00:16:22.280;However, I personally believe,
00:16:24.000;and I cannot prove any of this,
00:16:25.760;I personally believe that they're probably
00:16:27.200;gonna be peaceful because there's nothing
00:16:29.840;that they want from our world.
00:16:32.960;I mean, what are they gonna take us?
00:16:34.520;What are they gonna take us for, gold?
00:16:36.560;No, gold is a useless metal for the most part.
00:16:40.560;It's silver, I mean, it's gold in color,
00:16:43.620;but that only affects homo sapiens.
00:16:45.660;Squirrels don't care about gold.
00:16:47.820;And so gold is a rather useless element.
00:16:50.620;Rare earths, maybe, platinum-based elements,
00:16:53.180;rare earths for the electronics, yeah, maybe.
00:16:55.740;But other than that, we have nothing to offer them.
00:16:59.340;I mean, think about it for a moment.
00:17:01.700;People love Shakespeare and they love the arts and poetry,
00:17:06.620;but outside of the earth, they mean nothing.
00:17:10.260;Absolutely nothing.
00:17:12.400;I mean, when I write down an equation in string theory,
00:17:15.880;I would hope that on the other side of the galaxy,
00:17:19.840;there's an alien writing down that very same equation
00:17:22.940;in different notation,
00:17:24.760;but that alien on the other side of the galaxy,
00:17:27.280;Shakespeare, poetry, Hemingway,
00:17:30.420;it would mean nothing to him or her or it.
00:17:35.100;When you think about entities that's out there,
00:17:38.120;extraterrestrial,
00:17:40.040;do you think they would naturally look
00:17:43.920;something that even is recognizable to us as life
00:17:48.040;or would they be radically different?
00:17:50.600;Well, how did we become intelligent?
00:17:52.880;Basically, three things made us intelligent.
00:17:56.200;One is our eyesight, stereo eyesight.
00:17:59.360;We have the eyes of a hunter.
00:18:01.200;Stereo vision, so we lock in on targets.
00:18:04.280;And who is smarter, predator or prey?
00:18:09.400;Predators are smarter than prey.
00:18:11.600;They have their eyes to the front of their face,
00:18:13.280;like lions, tigers,
00:18:15.720;while rabbits have eyes to the side of their face.
00:18:18.840;Why is that?
00:18:19.880;Hunters have to zero in on the target.
00:18:22.800;They have to know how to ambush.
00:18:24.620;They have to know how to hide, camouflage,
00:18:27.040;sneak up, stealth, deceit.
00:18:30.220;That takes a lot of intelligence.
00:18:32.020;Rabbits, all they have to do is run.
00:18:35.280;So that's the first criterion,
00:18:36.860;stereo eyesight of some sort.
00:18:39.980;Second is the thumb.
00:18:42.860;The opposable thumb of some sort
00:18:44.700;could be a claw or tentacle.
00:18:46.180;So hand-eye coordination.
00:18:48.740;Hand-eye coordination is the way
00:18:50.340;we manipulate the environment.
00:18:52.860;And then three, language.
00:18:55.120;Because, you know, mama bear never tells baby bear
00:18:58.260;to avoid the human hunter.
00:19:00.420;Bears just learn by themselves.
00:19:02.420;They never hand out information
00:19:04.120;from one generation to the next.
00:19:06.320;So these are the three basic ingredients of intelligence.
00:19:10.260;Eyesight of some sort,
00:19:11.980;an opposable thumb or tentacle or claw of some sort,
00:19:15.140;and language.
00:19:16.700;Now ask yourself a simple question.
00:19:19.140;How many animals have all three?
00:19:22.460;Just us.
00:19:23.540;It's just us.
00:19:25.260;I mean, the primates, they have a language.
00:19:28.060;Yeah, they may get up to maybe 20 words,
00:19:30.820;but a baby learns a word a day.
00:19:32.780;Several words a day a baby learns.
00:19:35.220;And a typical adult knows about almost 5,000 words.
00:19:41.080;While the maximum number of words
00:19:42.880;that you can teach a gorilla in any language,
00:19:46.680;including their own language, is about 20 or so.
00:19:49.760;And so we see the difference in intelligence.
00:19:53.160;So when we meet aliens from outer space,
00:19:55.640;chances are they will have been descended from predators.
00:00:00.000;of some sort. They'll have some way to manipulate the environment and communicate their knowledge
00:00:05.560;to the next generation. That's it, folks.
00:00:09.160;So functionally, that would be similar. We would be able to recognize them.
00:00:15.840;Well, not necessarily, because I think even with homo sapiens, we are eventually going
00:00:21.200;to perhaps become part cybernetic and genetically enhanced.
00:00:28.360;Pretty soon, robots are getting smarter and smarter. Right now, robots have the intelligence
00:00:33.800;of a cockroach. But in the coming years, our robots will be as smart as a mouse, then maybe
00:00:40.960;as smart as a rabbit. If we're lucky, maybe as smart as a cat or a dog. And by the end
00:00:47.880;of the century, who knows for sure, our robots will be probably as smart as a monkey.
00:00:53.760;Now at that point, of course, they could be dangerous. You see, monkeys are self-aware.
00:00:59.800;They know they are monkeys. They may have a different agenda than us. While dogs, dogs
00:01:08.200;are confused. You see, dogs think that we are a dog, that we're the top dog. They're
00:01:16.480;the underdog. That's why they whimper and follow us and lick us all the time. We're
00:01:21.400;the top dog. Monkeys have no illusion at all. They know we are not monkeys. And so
00:01:28.520;I think that in the future, we'll have to put a chip in their brain to shut them off
00:01:32.840;once our robots have murderous thoughts. But that's in 100 years. In 200 years, the robots
00:01:40.240;will be smart enough to remove that failsafe chip in their brain and then watch out. At
00:01:46.960;that point, I think rather than compete with our robots, we should merge with them. We
00:01:54.920;should become part cybernetic. So I think when we meet alien life from outer space,
00:01:59.640;they may be genetically and cybernetically enhanced.
00:02:06.080;Genetically and cybernetically enhanced. Wow. So let's talk about that full range in the
00:02:11.240;near term and 200 years from now. How promising in the near term, in your view, is brain-machine
00:02:17.840;interfaces? So starting to allow computers to talk directly to the brains, Elon Musk
00:02:25.040;is working on that with Neuralink, and there's other companies working on this idea. Do you
00:02:29.200;see promise there? Do you see hope for near-term impact?
00:02:33.120;Well every technology has pluses and minuses. Already we can record memories. I have a book,
00:02:39.480;The Future of the Mind, where I detail some of these breakthroughs. We can now record
00:02:43.720;simple memories of mice and send these memories on the internet. Eventually we're going to
00:02:50.240;do this with primates at Wake Forest University and also in Los Angeles. And then after that,
00:02:57.800;we'll have a memory chip for Alzheimer's patients. We'll test it out in Alzheimer's patients
00:03:02.760;because of course when Alzheimer's patients lose their memory, they wander. They create
00:03:08.240;all sorts of havoc, wandering around, oblivious to their surroundings. And they'll have a
00:03:14.960;chip. They'll push the button and memories, memories will come flooding into their hippocampus
00:03:21.080;and the chip, telling them where they live and who they are. And so a memory chip is
00:03:27.840;definitely in the cards. And I think this will eventually affect human civilization.
00:03:33.320;What is the future of the internet? The future of the internet is brainnet. Brainnet is when
00:03:38.720;we send emotions, feelings, sensations on the internet. And we will telepathically communicate
00:03:46.600;with other humans this way. This is going to affect everything. Look at entertainment.
00:03:52.680;Remember the silent movies? Charlie Chaplin was very famous during the era of silent movies.
00:03:58.120;But when the talkies came in, nobody wanted to see Charlie Chaplin anymore because he
00:04:03.320;never talked in the movies. And so a whole generation of actors lost their job and a
00:04:09.040;new series of actors came in. Next, we're going to have the movies replaced by brainnet
00:04:16.920;because in the future, people will say, who wants to see a screen with images? That's
00:04:23.560;it. Sound and image, that's called the movies. Our entertainment industry, this multi-billion
00:04:30.080;dollar industry, is based on screens with moving images and sound. But what happens
00:04:36.320;when emotions, feelings, sensations, memories can be conveyed on the internet? It's going
00:04:43.440;to change everything. Human relations will change because you'll be able to empathize
00:04:47.680;and feel the suffering of other people. We'll be able to communicate telepathically. And
00:04:54.400;this is coming.
00:04:56.400;You described brainnet in Future of the Mind. This is an interesting concept. You mentioned
00:05:02.880;entertainment, but what kind of effect would it have on our personal relationships?
00:05:09.080;Hopefully it will deepen it. You realize that for most of human history, for over 90% of
00:05:15.320;human history, we only knew maybe 20, 100 people. That's it, folks. That was your tribe.
00:05:25.160;That was everybody you knew in the universe was only maybe 50 or 100. With the coming
00:05:32.300;of towns, of course, it expanded to a few thousand. With the coming of the telephone,
00:05:37.600;all of a sudden you could reach thousands of people with the telephone. And now with
00:05:42.080;the internet, you can reach the entire population of the planet Earth. And so I think this is
00:05:46.440;a normal progression.
00:05:48.840;And you think that kind of sort of connection to the rest of the world, and then adding
00:05:54.560;sensations like being able to share telepathically emotions and so on, that would just further
00:05:59.960;deepen our connection to our fellow humans?
00:06:02.480;Yeah, that's right. In fact, I disagree with many scientists on this question. Most scientists
00:06:08.760;would say that technology is neutral, a double-edged sword. One side of the sword can cut against
00:06:15.080;people. The other side of the sword can cut against ignorance and disease. I disagree.
00:06:22.360;I think technology does have a moral direction. Look at the internet. The internet spreads
00:06:28.600;knowledge, awareness, and that creates empowerment. People act on knowledge. When they begin to
00:06:36.000;realize that they don't have to live that way, they don't have to suffer under a dictatorship,
00:06:41.200;that there are other ways of living under freedom, then they begin to take things, take
00:06:47.160;power. And that spreads democracy. And democracies do not war with other democracies.
00:06:54.240;I'm a scientist. I believe in data. So let's take a sheet of paper and write down every
00:07:00.480;single war you had to learn since you were in elementary school. Every single war. Hundreds
00:07:07.400;of them. Kings, queens, emperors, dictators. All these wars were between kings, queens,
00:07:13.680;emperors, and dictators. Never between two major democracies. And so I think with the
00:07:20.680;spread of this technology, which would accelerate with the coming of brain net, it means that,
00:07:26.880;well, we will still have wars. Wars, of course, is politics by other means, but they'll be
00:07:32.320;less intense and less frequent.
00:07:35.560;Do you have worries of longer term existential risk from technology, from AI? So I think
00:07:45.440;that's a wonderful vision of a future where war is a distant memory. But now there's another
00:07:52.680;agent. There's somebody else that's able to create conflict, that's able to create harm.
00:07:59.920;AI systems. Do you have worry about such AI systems?
00:08:03.000;Well, yes, that is an existential risk. But again, I think an existential risk not for this century.
00:08:09.720;I think our grandkids are going to have to confront this question as robots gradually
00:08:14.680;approach the intelligence of a dog, a cat, and finally that of a monkey. However, I think
00:08:21.320;we will digitize ourselves as well. Not only are we going to merge with our technology,
00:08:25.880;we'll also digitize our personality, our memories, our feelings. You realize that during the
00:08:31.800;Middle Ages, there was something called dualism. Dualism meant that the soul was separate from
00:08:37.240;the body. When the body died, the soul went to heaven. That's dualism. Then in the 20th
00:08:43.400;century, neuroscience came in and said, bah, humbug. Every time we look at the brain, it's
00:08:49.480;just neurons. That's it, folks. Period. End of story. Bunch of neurons firing. Now we're
00:08:57.240;going back to dualism. Now we realize that we can digitize human memories, feelings,
00:09:04.120;sensations, and create a digital copy of ourselves, and that's called the Connectome Project.
00:09:11.640;Billions of dollars are now being spent to do not just the genome project of sequencing
00:09:18.120;the genes of our body, but the Connectome Project, which is to map the entire connections
00:09:24.120;of the human brain. Even before then, already in Silicon Valley, today, at this very moment,
00:09:31.400;you can contact Silicon Valley companies that are willing to digitize your relatives. Some
00:09:37.720;people want to talk to their parents. There are unresolved issues with their parents.
00:09:42.800;One day, yes, firms will digitize people, and you'll be able to talk to them
00:09:47.440;a reasonable facsimile. We leave a digital trail. Our ancestors did not. Our ancestors
00:09:54.640;were lucky if they had one line, just one line in a church book saying the date they were baptized
00:10:02.560;and the date they died. That's it. That was their entire digital memory. I mean, their entire
00:10:09.040;digital existence summarized in just a few letters of the alphabet, a whole life. Now,
00:10:16.480;we digitize everything. Every time you sneeze, you digitize it. You put it on the internet.
00:10:22.640;And so I think that we are going to digitize ourselves and give us digital immortality.
00:10:27.840;We'll not only have biologic genetic immortality of some sort, but also digital immortality.
00:10:34.800;And what are we going to do with it? I think we should send it into outer space.
00:10:40.800;If you digitize the human brain and put it on a laser beam and shoot it to the moon,
00:10:46.400;you're on the moon in one second. Shoot it to Mars, you're on Mars in 20 minutes. Shoot it to
00:10:52.240;Pluto, you're on Pluto in eight hours. Think about it for a moment. You can have breakfast in New York
00:10:58.400;and for a morning snack, vacation on the moon, then zap your way to Mars by noontime,
00:11:05.440;journey to the asteroid belt of the afternoon, and they come back for dinner in New York at night.
00:11:11.920;All in a day's work at the speed of light. Now, this means that you don't need booster rockets.
00:11:19.520;You don't need weightlessness problems. You don't need to worry about meteorites. And what's on the
00:11:24.320;moon? On the moon, there is a mainframe that downloads your laser beam's information. And
00:11:31.120;where does it download the information into? An avatar. And what does that avatar look like?
00:11:37.760;Anything you want. Think about it for a moment. You could be Superman, Superwoman on the moon,
00:11:46.080;on Mars, traveling throughout the universe at the speed of light, downloading your personality into
00:11:53.360;any vehicle you want. Now, let me stick my neck out. So far, everything I've been saying is well
00:11:59.200;within the laws of physics, well within the laws of physics. Now, let me go outside the laws of
00:12:04.080;physics again. Here we go. I think this already exists. I think outside the Earth, there could
00:12:10.480;be a super highway, a laser highway of laser porting with billions of souls of aliens zapping
00:12:18.080;their way across the galaxy. Now, let me ask you a question. Are we smart enough to determine whether
00:12:25.440;such a thing exists or not? No. This could exist right outside the orbit of the planet Earth.
00:12:32.800;And we're too stupid in our technology to even prove it or disprove it. We would need the aliens
00:12:41.120;on this laser super highway to help us out, to send us a human interpretable signal.
00:12:50.400;I mean, it ultimately boils down to the language of communication, but that's an exciting possibility
00:12:54.880;that actually the sky is filled with aliens. The aliens could already be here and we're just so oblivious
00:13:02.960;that we're too stupid to know it. See, they don't have to be in alien form with little green men.
00:13:09.600;They can be in any form they want, in an avatar of their creation. Well, in fact, they could very well be...
00:13:16.000;They could even look like us. Exactly. We'd never know. One of us could be an alien. You know, in the zoo,
00:13:22.080;did you know that we sometimes have zookeepers that imitate animals? We create a fake animal
00:13:28.000;and we put it in so that the animal is not afraid of this fake animal. And of course, these animals'
00:13:34.480;brains, their brain is about as big as a walnut. They accept these dummies as if they were real.
00:13:41.520;So an alien civilization in outer space would say, oh yeah, human brains are so tiny,
00:13:46.320;we could put a dummy on their world, an avatar, and they'd never know it. That would be an entertaining
00:13:52.640;thing to watch from the alien perspective. So you kind of implied that with a digital form
00:13:58.720;of our being, but also biologically. Do you think one day technology will allow individual
00:14:04.960;human beings to become immortal, besides just through the ability to digitize our essence?
00:14:11.440;Yeah, I think that artificial intelligence will give us the key to genetic immortality. You see,
00:14:17.600;in the coming decades, everyone's going to have their gene sequence. We'll have billions of genomes
00:14:22.640;of old people, billions of genomes of young people. And what are we going to do with it?
00:14:28.000;We're going to run it through an AI machine, which has pattern recognition, to look for the
00:14:33.200;age genes. In other words, the fountain of youth that emperors, kings, and queens lusted over,
00:14:41.760;the fountain of youth will be found by artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence will
00:14:47.440;identify where these age genes are located. First of all, what is aging? We now know what aging is.
00:14:55.760;Aging is the buildup of errors. That's all aging is, the buildup of genetic errors. This means that
00:15:04.160;cells eventually become slower, sluggish, and they go into senescence, and they die. In fact,
00:15:11.280;that's why we die. We die because of the buildup of mistakes in our genome, in our cellular
00:15:19.440;activity. But you see, in the future, we'll be able to fix those genes with CRISPR-type
00:15:23.920;technologies, and perhaps even live forever. So let me ask you a question. Where does aging
00:15:30.080;take place in a car? Given a car, where does aging take place? Well, it's obvious, the engine, right?
00:15:37.440;A, that's where you have a lot of moving parts. B, that's where you have combustion. Well, where
00:15:42.960;in the cell do we have combustion? The mitochondria. We now know where aging takes place.
00:15:51.920;And if we cure many of the mistakes that build up in the mitochondria of the cell,
00:15:56.640;we could become immortal. Let me ask you, if you yourself could become immortal, would you?
00:16:06.160;Damn straight. No, I think about it for a while because, of course, it depends on how you become
00:16:13.840;immortal. You know, there's a famous myth of Tithonus. It turns out that years ago in the
00:16:19.760;Greeks mythology, there was the saga of Tithonus and Aurora. Aurora was the goddess of the dawn,
00:16:28.240;and she fell in love with a mortal, a human called Tithonus. And so Aurora begged Zeus to grant her
00:16:38.160;the gift of immortality to give to her lover. So Zeus took pity on Aurora and made Tithonus
00:16:46.000;immortal. But you see, Aurora made a mistake, a huge mistake. She asked for immortality,
00:16:54.720;but she forgot to ask for eternal youth. So poor Tithonus got older and older and older every year,
00:17:03.440;decrepit, a bag of bones, but he could never die, never die. Quality of life is important.
00:17:11.520;So I think immortality is a great idea as long as you also have immortal youth as well. Now I
00:17:18.400;personally believe, and I cannot prove this, but I personally believe that our grandkids may have
00:17:22.880;the option of reaching the age of 30 and then stopping. They may like being age 30 because you
00:17:31.040;have wisdom, you have all the benefits of age and maturity, and you still live forever with a healthy
00:17:38.160;body. Our descendants may like being 30 for several centuries. Is there an aspect of human
00:17:44.480;existence that is meaningful only because we're mortal? Well, every waking moment, we don't think
00:17:52.560;about it this way, but every waking moment, actually, we are aware of our death and our
00:17:58.960;mortality. Think about it for a moment. When you go to college, you realize that you are in a period
00:18:05.280;of time where soon you will reach middle age and have a career. And after that, you'll retire and
00:18:12.320;then you'll die. And so even as a youth, even as a child, without even thinking about it, you are
00:18:19.920;aware of your own death because it sets limits to your lifespan. I got to graduate from high school,
00:18:26.080;I got to graduate from college. Why? Because you're going to die. Because unless you graduate
00:18:32.080;from high school, unless you graduate from college, you're not going to enter old age with
00:18:36.240;enough money to retire and then die. And so, yeah, people think about it unconsciously because it
00:18:43.120;affects every aspect of your being. The fact that you go to high school, college, get married, have
00:18:50.160;kids, there's a clock, a clock ticking even without your permission. It gives a sense of urgency.
00:18:58.800;There's so much excitement and passion in the way you talk about physics and the way you talk about
00:19:05.760;technology in the future. Do you yourself meditate on your own mortality? Do you think about this
00:19:12.800;clock that's ticking? Well, I try not to because it then begins to affect your behavior. You begin
00:19:20.080;to alter your behavior to match your expectation of when you're going to die. So let's talk about
00:19:27.360;youth and then let's talk about death. When I interview scientists on radio, I often ask them,
00:19:36.560;what made the difference? How old were you? What changed your life? And they always say more or
00:19:42.880;less the same thing. These are Nobel Prize winners, directors of major laboratories,
00:19:46.960;very distinguished scientists. They always say, when I was 10. When I was 10, something happened.
00:19:54.560;It was a visit to the planetarium. It was a telescope.
00:00:00.000;Weinberg, winner of the Nobel Prize, it was the chemistry kit. For Heinz Pagels, it was a visit
00:00:05.360;to the planetarium. For Isidore Rabi, it was a book about the planets. For Albert Einstein,
00:00:12.160;it was a compass. Something happened which gives them this existential shock. Because you see,
00:00:19.200;before the age of 10, everything is mommy and daddy, mommy and dad. That's your universe,
00:00:23.360;mommy and daddy. Around the age of 10, you begin to wonder, what's beyond mommy and daddy?
00:00:30.720;And that's when you have this epiphany, when you realize, oh, my God, there's a universe
00:00:37.520;out there, a universe of discovery. And that sensation stays with you for the rest of your
00:00:44.560;life. You still remember that shock that you felt gazing at the universe. And then you hit the
00:00:52.720;greatest destroyer of scientists known to science. The greatest destroyer of scientists known to
00:01:00.960;science is junior high school. When you hit junior high school, folks, it's all over. It's all over.
00:01:10.640;Because in junior high school, people say, hey, stupid. I mean, you like that nerdy stuff.
00:01:17.600;And your friends shun you. All of a sudden, people think you're a weirdo. And science is
00:01:23.680;made boring. You know, Richard Feynman, the Nobel Prize winner, when he was a child,
00:01:28.880;his father would take him into the forest. And the father would teach him everything about
00:01:33.920;birds, why they're shaped the way they are, their wings, the coloration, the shape of their beak,
00:01:40.560;everything about birds. So one day, a bully comes up to the future Nobel Prize winner and says,
00:01:46.960;hey, Dick, what's the name of that bird over there? Well, he didn't know. He knew everything
00:01:54.960;about that bird except its name. So he said, I don't know. And then the bully said, what's the
00:02:02.400;matter, Dick? You stupid or something? And then in that instant, he got it. He got it. He realized
00:02:10.800;that for most people, science is giving names to birds. That's what science is. You know, lots of
00:02:18.400;names of obscure things. Hey, people say, you're smart. You're smart. You know all the names of
00:02:23.680;the dinosaurs. You know all the names of the plants. No, that's not science at all. Science
00:02:30.320;is about principles, concepts, physical pictures. That's what science is all about. My favorite quote
00:02:39.120;from Einstein is that unless you can explain the theory to a child, the theory is probably worthless.
00:02:47.840;Meaning that all great theories are not big words. All great theories are simple concepts,
00:02:55.760;principles, basic physical pictures. Relativity is all about clocks, meter sticks, rocket ships,
00:03:05.360;and locomotives. Newton's laws of gravity are all about balls and spinning wheels and things like
00:03:12.240;that. That's what physics and science is all about, not memorizing things. And that stays with you
00:03:19.040;for the rest of your life. So even in old age, I've noticed that these scientists, when they sit
00:03:25.040;back, they still remember. They still remember that flush, that flush of excitement they felt
00:03:32.960;with that first telescope, that first moment when they encountered the universe. That keeps them
00:03:39.200;going. That keeps them going. By the way, I should point out that when I was eight, something happened
00:03:47.040;to me as well. When I was eight years old, it was in all the papers that a great scientist had
00:03:55.280;just died, and they put a picture of his desk on the front page. That's it. Just a simple picture
00:04:02.400;of the front page of the newspapers of his desk. That desk had a book on it, which was opened,
00:04:09.040;and the caption said, more or less, this is the unfinished manuscript from the greatest scientists
00:04:15.680;of our time. So I said to myself, well, why couldn't he finish it? What's so hard that you can't
00:04:25.040;finish it if you're a great scientist? It's a homework problem, right? You go home, you solve it,
00:04:30.320;or you ask your mom, why couldn't he solve it? So to me, this was a murder mystery. This was greater
00:04:36.000;than any adventure story. I had to know why the greatest scientists of our time couldn't finish
00:04:42.080;something. And then over the years, I found out the guy had a name, Albert Einstein, and that book
00:04:49.280;was the theory of everything. It was unfinished. Well, today, I can read that book. I can see all
00:04:56.800;the dead ends and false starts that he made, and I began to realize that he lost his way,
00:05:02.480;because he didn't have a physical picture to guide him on the third try. On the first try,
00:05:11.120;he talked about clocks and lightning bolts and meter sticks, and that gave us special relativity,
00:05:17.600;which gave us the atomic bomb. The second great picture was gravity with balls rolling on curved
00:05:25.600;surfaces, and that gave us the Big Bang, creation of the universe, black holes. On the third try,
00:05:33.280;he missed it. He had no picture at all to guide him. In fact, there's a quote I have where he said,
00:05:40.480;I'm still looking. I'm still looking for that picture. He never found it. Well, today, we think
00:05:46.880;that picture is string theory. The string theory can unify gravity and this mysterious thing that
00:05:53.600;Einstein didn't like, which is quantum mechanics, or couldn't quite pin down and make sense of.
00:05:59.120;That's right. Mother Nature has two hands, a left hand and a right hand. The left hand is a theory
00:06:04.080;of the small. The right hand is a theory of the big. The theory of the small is the quantum theory,
00:06:09.760;the theory of atoms and quarks. The theory of the big is relativity, the theory of black holes,
00:06:15.120;Big Bangs. The problem is the left hand does not talk to the right hand. They hate each other.
00:06:24.320;The left hand is based on discrete particles. The right hand is based on smooth surfaces.
00:06:30.960;How do you put these two things together into a single theory? They hate each other.
00:06:35.760;The greatest minds of our time, the greatest minds of our time worked on this problem and failed.
00:06:43.120;Today, the only one, the only theory that has survived every challenge so far is string theory.
00:06:49.360;That doesn't mean string theory is correct. It could very well be wrong. But right now,
00:06:54.320;it's the only game in town. Some people come up to me and say, Professor, I don't believe
00:06:59.120;in string theory. Give me an alternative. And I tell them, there is none. Get used to it.
00:07:07.600;It's the best theory we got. It's the only theory we have. It's the only theory we have.
00:07:13.040;Do you see, you know, the strings kind of inspire a view, as did atoms and particles and quarks,
00:07:23.120;but especially strings inspire a view of a universe as a kind of information processing
00:07:28.560;system, as a computer of sorts. Do you see the universe in this way?
00:07:33.840;No. Some people think, in fact, the whole universe is a computer of some sort.
00:07:39.200;Yes.
00:07:39.840;And they believe that perhaps everything, therefore, is a simulation.
00:07:44.000;Yes.
00:07:44.880;I don't think so. I don't think that there is a super video game where we are nothing but puppets
00:07:51.120;dancing on the screen and somebody hit the play button and here we are talking about simulations.
00:07:57.520;No. Even Newtonian mechanics says that the weather, the simple weather, is so complicated
00:08:04.720;with trillions upon trillions of atoms that it cannot be simulated in a finite amount of time.
00:08:10.800;In other words, the smallest object which can describe the weather and simulate the weather
00:08:18.640;is the weather itself. The smallest object that can simulate a human is the human itself.
00:08:26.880;And if you had quantum mechanics, it becomes almost impossible to simulate it with a
00:08:32.800;conventional computer. Because quantum mechanics deals with all possible universes, parallel
00:08:39.120;universes, a multiverse of universes. And so the calculation just spirals out of control.
00:08:46.560;Now, at so far, there's only one way where you might be able to argue that the universe is a
00:08:53.040;simulation. And this is still being debated by quantum physicists. It turns out that if
00:08:59.040;you throw the encyclopedia into a black hole, the information is not lost. Eventually, it winds up
00:09:04.960;on the surface of the black hole. Now, the surface of the black hole is finite. In fact, you can
00:09:10.640;calculate the maximum amount of information you can store in a black hole. It's a finite number.
00:09:16.960;It's a calculable number, believe it or not. Now, if the universe were made out of black holes,
00:09:21.600;which is the maximum universe you can conceive of, each universe, each black hole has a finite
00:09:27.840;amount of information. Therefore, ergo, the total amount of information in a universe is finite.
00:09:38.720;This is mind boggling. This I consider mind boggling, that all possible universes are
00:09:45.200;countable. And all possible universes can be summarized in a number, a number you can write
00:09:50.960;on a sheet of paper, all possible universes. And it's a finite number. Now, it's huge. It's a number
00:09:56.960;beyond human imagination. It's a number based on what is called a Planck length. But it's a number.
00:10:03.600;And so if a computer could ever simulate that number, then the universe would be a simulation.
00:10:09.920;So theoretically, because the amount of information is finite, there necessarily must
00:10:17.840;be able to exist a computer. It's just from an engineering perspective, maybe impossible to build.
00:10:23.920;Yes, no computer can build a universe capable of simulating the entire universe,
00:10:29.200;except the universe itself. So that's your intuition, that our universe is very efficient.
00:10:35.280;And so there's no shortcuts. Right. Two reasons why I believe the universe is not a simulation.
00:10:41.200;First, the calculational numbers are just incredible. No finite Turing machine can
00:10:47.120;simulate the universe. And second, why would any super intelligent being simulate humans?
00:10:54.240;If you think about it, most humans are kind of stupid. I mean, we do all sorts of crazy,
00:10:59.360;stupid things, right? And we call it art. We call it humor. We call it human civilization.
00:11:06.240;So why should an advanced civilization go through all that effort just to simulate Saturday Night
00:11:12.640;Live? Well, that's a funny idea. But it's also, do you think it's possible that the act of creation
00:11:20.080;cannot anticipate humans? You simply set the initial conditions and set a bunch of physical
00:11:25.200;laws and just for the fun of it, see what happens. You launch the thing. So you're not necessarily
00:11:30.640;simulating everything. You're not simulating every little bit in the sense that you could
00:11:35.680;predict what's going to happen. But you set the initial conditions, set the laws and see what
00:11:41.440;kind of fun stuff happens. Well, in some sense, that's how life got started. In the 1950s, Stanley
00:11:49.280;did what is called the Miller experiment. He put a bunch of hydrogen gas, methane, toxic gases
00:11:57.680;with liquid and a spark in a small glass beaker. And then he just walked away for a few weeks,
00:12:05.040;came back a few weeks later and bingo, out of nothing in chaos came amino acids.
00:12:12.720;If he had left it there for a few years, he might have gotten protein, protein molecules for free.
00:12:19.120;That's probably how life got started as a accident. And if he had left it there for perhaps
00:12:25.600;a few million years, DNA might have formed in that beaker. And so we think that, yeah, DNA,
00:12:32.960;life, all that could have been an accident if you wait long enough. And remember, our universe is
00:12:39.680;roughly 13.8 billion years old. That's plenty of time for lots of random things to happen,
00:12:46.800;including life itself. Yeah, we could be just a beautiful little random moment. And there's could
00:12:57.520;be, you know, the infinite number of those throughout the history of the universe. Many
00:13:03.280;creatures like us, we perhaps are not the epitome of what the universe was created for. Thank God.
00:13:09.760;Let's hope not. Just look around. Yeah. Look to your left, look to your right.
00:13:16.080;When do you think the first human will step foot on Mars? I think it's a good chance in the 2030s
00:13:23.280;that we will be on Mars. In fact, there's no physics reason why we can't do it. It's an
00:13:29.920;engineering problem. It's a very difficult and dangerous engineering problem, but it is an
00:13:35.200;engineering problem. And in my book, Future of Humanity, I even speculate beyond that,
00:13:41.040;that by the end of the century, we'll probably have the first starships. The first starships
00:13:46.640;will not look like the Enterprise at all. There'll probably be small computer chips that are fired by
00:13:52.480;laser beams with parachutes. And like what Stephen Hawking advocated, the Breakthrough
00:13:59.040;Starshot program could send chips, chips to the nearby stars traveling at 20% the speed of light,
00:14:05.440;reaching Alpha Centauri in about 20 years time. Beyond that, we should have fusion power.
00:14:12.800;Fusion power is, in some sense, one of the ultimate sources of energy,
00:14:17.920;but it's unstable. And we don't have fusion power today. Now, why is that? First of all,
00:14:24.160;stars form almost for free. You get a bunch of gas, large enough, it becomes a star. I mean,
00:14:30.000;you don't even have to do anything to it, and it becomes a star. Why is fusion so difficult to put
00:14:36.320;on the Earth? Because in outer space, stars are monopoles. They are poles, single poles that are
00:14:43.120;spherically symmetric, and it's very easy to get spherically symmetric configurations of gas
00:14:48.800;to compress into a star. It just happens naturally all by itself. The problem is magnetism is
00:14:55.280;bipolar. You have a North Pole and a South Pole, and it's like trying to squeeze a long balloon.
00:15:02.240;Take a long balloon and try to squeeze it. You squeeze one side, it bulges out the other side.
00:15:08.080;Well, that's the problem with fusion machines. We use magnetism with the North Pole and the South
00:15:12.800;Pole to squeeze gas, and all sorts of anomalies and horrible configurations can take place,
00:15:20.160;because we're not squeezing something uniformly like in a star. Stars, in some sense, are for free.
00:15:27.120;Fusion on the Earth is very difficult. But I think it's inevitable, and it'll eventually give us
00:15:34.480;unlimited power from seawater. So seawater will be the ultimate source of energy for the planet
00:15:40.400;Earth. Why? What's the intuition there? Because we'll extract hydrogen from seawater, burn hydrogen
00:15:46.320;in a fission reactor to give us unlimited energy without the meltdown, without the nuclear waste.
00:15:53.840;Why do we have meltdowns? We have meltdowns because in the fission reactors, every time you split the
00:15:58.560;uranium atom, you get nuclear waste. Tons of it. 30 tons of nuclear waste per reactor per year.
00:16:07.040;And it's hot. It's hot for thousands, millions of years. That's why we have meltdowns. But you see,
00:16:13.600;the waste product of a fusion reactor is helium gas. Helium gas is actually commercially valuable.
00:16:19.760;You can make money selling helium gas. And so the waste product of a fusion reactor is helium,
00:16:26.160;not nuclear waste that we find in a commercial fission plant.
00:16:30.640;And that controlling, mastering and controlling fusion allows us to convert this into a type one,
00:16:38.240;I guess, civilization, right?
00:16:40.080;Yeah, probably the backbone of a type one civilization will be fusion power. We, by the
00:16:46.080;way, are type zero. We don't even rate on this scale. We get our energy from dead plants, for
00:16:51.280;God's sake, oil and coal. But we are about 100 years from being type one. You know, get a
00:16:56.480;calculator. In fact, Carl Sagan calculated that we are about 0.7. Fairly close to a 1.0. For example,
00:17:07.120;what is the Internet? The Internet is the beginning of the first type one technology
00:17:12.160;to enter into our century. The first planetary technology is the Internet.
00:17:17.360;What is the language of type one? On the Internet already, English and Mandarin Chinese
00:17:23.360;are the most dominant languages on the Internet. And what about the culture? We're seeing a type
00:17:30.480;one sports, soccer, the Olympics, a type one music, youth culture, rock and roll, rap music,
00:17:38.800;type one fashion, Gucci, Chanel, a type one economy, the European Union, NAFTA, what have you.
00:17:45.440;So we're beginning to see the beginnings of a type one culture and a type one civilization.
00:17:52.480;Inevitably, it will spread beyond this planet. You talked about sending at 20% the speed of light
00:18:00.640;on a chip into Alpha Centauri. But in a slightly nearer term, what do you think about the idea
00:18:08.800;when we still have to send our biological bodies, the colonization of planets, colonization of Mars?
00:18:16.400;Do you see us becoming a two planet species ever or anytime soon? Well, just remember the dinosaurs
00:18:26.240;did not have a space program. And that's why they're not here today. How come there are no
00:18:30.880;dinosaurs in this room today? Because they didn't have a space program. We do have a space program,
00:18:37.920;which means that we have an insurance policy. Now, I don't think we should bankrupt the Earth
00:18:42.960;or deplete the Earth to go to Mars. That's too expensive and not practical. But we need a
00:18:48.240;settlement, a settlement on Mars in case something bad happens to the planet Earth. And that means we
00:18:54.400;have to terraform Mars. Now, to terraform Mars, if we could raise the temperature of Mars by six degrees,
00:19:01.360;six degrees, then the polar ice caps begin to melt, releasing water vapor. Water vapor is the greenhouse gas.
00:19:10.400;It causes even more melting of the ice caps. So it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. It feeds on itself.
00:19:18.720;It becomes autocatalytic. And so once you hit six degrees, rising of the temperature on Mars by six
00:19:25.280;degrees, it takes off. And we melt the polar ice caps and liquid water once again flows in the
00:19:32.880;rivers, the canals, the channels and the oceans of Mars. Mars once had an ocean, we think, about the size
00:19:40.400;of the United States. And so that is a possibility. Now, how do we get there? How do we raise the
00:19:46.640;temperature of Mars by six degrees? Elon Musk would like to detonate hydrogen warheads on the polar
00:19:52.160;ice caps. Well, I'm not sure about that because we don't know that much about the effects of...
00:00:00.000;detonating hydrogen warheads to melt the polar ice caps. And who wants to glow in the dark at
00:00:05.120;night reading the newspaper? So I think there are other ways to do it with solar satellites.
