00:00.000  ; The following is a conversation with Michio Kaku.
00:02.800  ; He's a theoretical physicist, futurist,
00:05.120  ; and professor at the City College of New York.
00:08.360  ; He's the author of many fascinating books
00:10.760  ; that explore the nature of our reality
00:12.840  ; and the future of our civilization.
00:15.520  ; They include Einstein's Cosmos, Physics of the Impossible,
00:19.200  ; Future of the Mind, Parallel Worlds,
00:21.600  ; and his latest, The Future of Humanity,
00:24.240  ; Terraforming Mars Interstellar Travel,
00:26.640  ; Immortality, and Our Destiny Beyond Earth.
00:29.960  ; I think it's beautiful and important
00:32.960  ; when a scientific mind can fearlessly explore
00:35.760  ; through conversation subjects
00:37.600  ; just outside of our understanding.
00:40.200  ; That, to me, is where artificial intelligence is today,
00:43.440  ; just outside of our understanding,
00:45.680  ; a place we have to reach for
00:47.440  ; if we're to uncover the mysteries of the human mind
00:50.160  ; and build human level and superhuman level AI systems
00:53.880  ; that transform our world for the better.
00:56.640  ; This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.

01:09.920  ; And now, here's my conversation with Michio Kaku.
01:14.680  ; You've mentioned that we just might make contact
01:17.360  ; with aliens or at least hear from them within this century.
01:21.740  ; Can you elaborate on your intuition behind that optimism?
01:25.880  ; Well, this is pure speculation, of course.
01:28.120  ; Of course.
01:28.960  ; Given the fact that we've already identified
01:31.200  ; 4,000 exoplanets orbiting other stars,
01:34.560  ; and we have a census of the Milky Way galaxy
01:37.560  ; for the first time,
01:39.160  ; we know that on average, every single star, on average,
01:43.560  ; has a planet going around it,
01:45.640  ; and about one fifth or so of them
01:47.720  ; have Earth sized planets going around them.
01:51.240  ; So just do the math.
01:52.960  ; We're talking about out of 100 billion stars
01:56.160  ; in the Milky Way galaxy,
01:58.140  ; we're talking about billions
01:59.820  ; of potential Earth sized planets.
02:02.880  ; And to believe that we're the only one
02:05.760  ; is, I think, rather ridiculous, given the odds.
02:09.160  ; And how many galaxies are there?
02:11.600  ; Within sight of the Hubble Space Telescope,
02:14.560  ; there are about 100 billion galaxies.
02:17.880  ; So do the math.
02:19.680  ; How many stars are there in the visible universe?
02:22.500  ; 100 billion galaxies,
02:24.780  ; times 100 billion stars per galaxy.
02:29.360  ; We're talking about a number beyond human imagination.
02:33.720  ; And to believe that we're the only ones,
02:35.480  ; I think, is rather ridiculous.
02:38.200  ; So you've talked about different types of,
02:42.180  ; type zero, one, two, three, four, and five,
02:44.500  ; even, of the Kardashev scale
02:47.200  ; of the different kind of civilizations.
02:50.440  ; What do you think it takes,
02:52.780  ; if it is indeed a ridiculous notion
02:54.640  ; that we're alone in the universe,
02:56.220  ; what do you think it takes to reach out?
02:58.720  ; First, to reach out through communication and connect.
03:02.660  ; Well, first of all, we have to understand
03:04.320  ; the level of sophistication of an alien life form
03:08.720  ; if we make contact with them.
03:10.520  ; I think in this century, we'll probably pick up signals,
03:14.160  ; signals from an extraterrestrial civilization.
03:17.400  ; We'll pick up there, I love Lucy,
03:19.260  ; and there, leave it to Beaver.
03:21.280  ; Just ordinary day to day transmissions
03:23.500  ; that they emit.
03:25.600  ; And the first thing we wanna do is to A,
03:28.200  ; decipher their language, of course,
03:30.260  ; but B, figure out at what level they are advanced
03:34.980  ; on the Kardashev scale.
03:37.080  ; I'm a physicist.
03:38.560  ; We rank things by two parameters, energy and information.
03:43.640  ; That's how we rank black holes.
03:45.600  ; That's how we rank stars.
03:47.320  ; That's how we rank civilizations in outer space.
03:50.600  ; So a type one civilization is capable
03:54.900  ; of harnessing planetary power.
03:57.540  ; They control the weather, for example, earthquakes, volcanoes.
04:01.280  ; They can modify the course of geological events,
04:04.600  ; sort of like Flash Gordon or Buck Rogers.
04:08.400  ; Type two would be stellar.
04:12.240  ; They play with stars, entire stars.
04:15.620  ; They use the entire energy output of a star,
04:18.440  ; sort of like Star Trek.
04:20.560  ; The Federation of Planets have colonized the nearby stars.
04:24.640  ; So a type two would be somewhat similar to Star Trek.
04:29.080  ; Type three would be galactic.
04:30.660  ; They roam the galactic space lanes.
04:33.840  ; And type three would be like Star Wars,
04:37.700  ; a galactic civilization.
04:39.880  ; Now, one day I was giving this talk in London
04:42.320  ; at the planetarium there, and the little boy comes up to me
04:45.580  ; and he says, professor, you're wrong.
04:48.760  ; You're wrong, there's type four.
04:51.000  ; And I told him, look, kid,
04:53.360  ; there are planets, stars, and galaxies.
04:57.000  ; That's it, folks.
04:58.720  ; And he kept persisting and saying, no, there's type four,
05:02.680  ; the power of the continuum.
05:05.800  ; And I thought about it for a moment.
05:07.560  ; And I said to myself,
05:08.600  ; is there an extra galactic source of energy,
05:12.220  ; the continuum of Star Trek?
05:14.520  ; And the answer is yes, there could be a type four.
05:18.080  ; And that's dark energy.
05:20.040  ; We now know that 73% of the energy of the universe
05:25.480  ; is dark energy.
05:27.560  ; Dark matter represents maybe 23% or so,
05:30.640  ; and we only represent 4%.
05:33.040  ; We're the oddballs.
05:34.640  ; And so you begin to realize that, yeah,
05:36.400  ; there could be type four, maybe even type five.
05:39.760  ; So type four, you're saying being able to harness
05:43.280  ; sort of like dark energy,
05:45.360  ; something that permeates the entire universe.
05:47.120  ; So be able to plug into the entire universe
05:51.000  ; as a source of energy.
05:52.080  ; That's right.
05:52.920  ; And dark energy is the energy of the Big Bang.
05:55.680  ; It's why the galaxies are being pushed apart.
05:58.920  ; It's the energy of nothing.
06:00.740  ; The more nothing you have,
06:02.560  ; the more dark energy that's repulsive.
06:05.400  ; And so the acceleration of the universe is accelerating
06:08.960  ; because the more you have, the more you can have.
06:12.560  ; And that, of course, is by definition an exponential curve.
06:15.780  ; It's called a de Sitter expansion,
06:17.600  ; and that's the current state of the universe.
06:20.480  ; And then type five, would that be able to seek
06:26.800  ; energy sources somehow outside of our universe?
06:31.040  ; And how crazy is that idea?
06:33.000  ; Yeah, type five will be the multiverse.
06:35.400  ; Multiverse, okay.
06:36.280  ; I'm a quantum physicist,
06:37.760  ; and we quantum physicists don't believe
06:40.280  ; that the Big Bang happened once.
06:42.120  ; That would violate the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.
06:45.120  ; And that means that there could be multiple bangs
06:47.880  ; happening all the time.
06:49.360  ; Even as we speak today,
06:52.120  ; universes are being created, and that fits the data.
06:56.180  ; The inflationary universe is a quantum theory.
06:59.960  ; So there's a certain finite probability
07:02.060  ; that universes are being created all the time.
07:05.120  ; And for me, this is actually rather aesthetically pleasing
07:08.740  ; because I was raised as a Presbyterian,
07:13.200  ; but my parents were Buddhists.
07:15.920  ; And there's two diametrically opposed ideas
07:19.520  ; about the universe.
07:21.080  ; In Buddhism, there's only nirvana.
07:23.240  ; There's no beginning, there's no end,
07:25.160  ; there's only timelessness.
07:26.940  ; But in Christianity, there is the instant
07:29.960  ; when God said, let there be light.
07:32.760  ; In other words, an instant of creation.
07:35.320  ; So I've had these two mutually exclusive ideas in my head,
07:40.160  ; and I now realize that it's possible to meld them
07:42.760  ; into a single theory.
07:45.120  ; Either the universe had a beginning or it didn't, right?
07:48.640  ; Wrong.
07:49.880  ; You see, our universe had a beginning.
07:53.160  ; Our universe had an instant where somebody might have said,
07:56.240  ; let there be light.
07:57.860  ; But there are other bubble universes out there
08:00.340  ; in a bubble bath of universes.
08:02.720  ; And that means that these universes are expanding
08:07.280  ; into a dimension beyond our three dimensional comprehension.
08:11.240  ; In other words, hyperspace.
08:13.080  ; In other words, 11 dimensional hyperspace.
08:16.360  ; So nirvana would be this timeless 11 dimensional hyperspace
08:21.680  ; where big bangs are happening all the time.
08:24.860  ; So we can now combine two mutually exclusive theories
08:28.640  ; of creation.
08:30.920  ; And Stephen Hawking, for example, even in his last book,
08:35.320  ; even said that this is an argument
08:37.120  ; against the existence of God.
08:39.320  ; He said there is no God because there was not enough time
08:42.680  ; for God to create the universe
08:44.320  ; because the big bang happened in an instant of time.
08:47.800  ; Therefore, there was no time available
08:50.400  ; for him to create the universe.
08:52.360  ; But you see, the multiverse idea
08:54.600  ; means that there was a time before time.
08:58.040  ; And there are multiple times, each bubble has its own time.
09:01.920  ; And so it means that there could actually be a universe
09:06.240  ; before the beginning of our universe.
09:09.640  ; So if you think of a bubble bath, when two bubbles collide,
09:13.640  ; or when two bubbles fission to create a baby bubble,
09:16.800  ; that's called the big bang.
09:18.800  ; So the big bang is nothing but the collision of universes
09:21.520  ; or the budding of universes.
09:23.720  ; That's such a beautiful picture
09:25.080  ; of our incredibly mysterious existence.
09:28.000  ; So is that humbling to you?
09:30.240  ; Exciting, the idea of multiverses?
09:32.840  ; I don't even know how to even begin
09:35.000  ; to wrap my mind around it.
09:37.640  ; It's exciting for me
09:38.480  ; because what I do for a living is string theory.
09:41.680  ; That's my day job.
09:43.040  ; I get paid by the city of New York to work on string theory.
09:46.840  ; And you see, string theory is a multiverse theory.
09:50.520  ; So people say, first of all, what is string theory?
09:53.400  ; String theory simply says that all the particles
09:55.640  ; we see in nature, the electron, the proton,
09:58.240  ; the quarks, what have you,
09:59.840  ; are nothing but vibrations on a musical string,
10:03.240  ; on a tiny, tiny little string.
10:05.920  ; You know, G. Robert Oppenheimer,
10:07.400  ; the creator of the atomic bomb,
10:09.640  ; was so frustrated in the 1950s
10:12.040  ; with all these subatomic particles being created
10:15.160  ; in our atom smashers that he announced,
10:18.240  ; he announced one day that the Nobel Prize in physics
10:22.680  ; should go to the physicist
10:23.960  ; who does not discover a new particle that year.
10:28.280  ; Well, today we think they're nothing but musical notes
10:30.600  ; on these tiny little vibrating strings.
10:32.960  ; So what is physics?
10:34.720  ; Physics is the harmonies you can write on vibrating strings.
10:38.600  ; What is chemistry?
10:40.160  ; Chemistry is the melodies you can play on these strings.
10:44.840  ; What is the universe?
10:47.040  ; The universe is a symphony of strings.
10:50.280  ; And then what is the mind of God
10:53.200  ; that Albert Einstein so eloquently wrote about
10:55.720  ; for the last 30 years of his life?
10:58.400  ; The mind of God would be cosmic music,
11:02.760  ; resonating through 11 dimensional hyperspace.
11:06.160  ; So beautifully put.
11:07.280  ; What do you think is the mind of Einstein's God?
11:11.880  ; Do you think there's a why that we could untangle
11:16.160  ; from this universe of strings?
11:19.760  ; Why are we here?
11:20.920  ; What is the meaning of it all?
11:23.320  ; Well, Steven Weinberg, winner of the Nobel Prize,
11:26.280  ; once said that the more we learn about the universe,
11:29.760  ; the more we learn that it's pointless.
11:32.240  ; Well, I don't know.
11:35.600  ; I don't profess to understand
11:37.280  ; the great secrets of the universe.
11:39.320  ; However, let me say two things
11:41.120  ; about what the giants of physics
11:43.320  ; have said about this question.
11:45.320  ; Einstein believed in two types of God.
11:49.320  ; One was the God of the Bible, the personal God,
11:54.280  ; the God that answers prayers, walks on waters,
11:56.560  ; performs miracles, smites the Philistines.
12:00.040  ; That's the personal God that he didn't believe in.
12:02.640  ; He believed in the God of Spinoza,
12:05.480  ; the God of order, simplicity, harmony, beauty.
12:10.040  ; The universe could have been ugly.
12:12.840  ; The universe could have been messy, random,
12:15.680  ; but it's gorgeous.
12:17.360  ; You realize that on a single sheet of paper,
12:19.960  ; we can write down all the known laws of the universe.
12:23.120  ; It's amazing, on one sheet of paper,
12:25.400  ; Einstein's equation is one inch long,
12:27.840  ; string theory is a lot longer,
12:30.040  ; and so it's a standard model,
12:31.960  ; but you could put all these equations
12:33.880  ; on one sheet of paper.
12:36.880  ; It didn't have to be that way.
12:38.640  ; It could have been messy.
12:40.240  ; And so, Einstein thought of himself as a young boy
12:43.160  ; entering this huge library for the first time,
12:47.480  ; being overwhelmed by the simplicity, elegance,
12:51.160  ; and beauty of this library,
12:53.160  ; but all he could do was read the first page
12:56.560  ; of the first volume.
12:58.320  ; Well, that library is the universe,
13:00.320  ; with all sorts of mysterious, magical things
13:03.240  ; that we have yet to find.
13:05.280  ; And then Galileo was asked about this.
13:07.920  ; Galileo said that the purpose of science,
13:13.000  ; the purpose of science is to determine how the heavens go.
13:17.680  ; The purpose of religion is to determine
13:20.680  ; how to go to heaven.
13:22.400  ; So in other words, science is about natural law,
13:26.200  ; and religion is about ethics,
13:29.480  ; how to be a good person, how to go to heaven.
13:32.320  ; As long as we keep these two things apart,
13:35.000  ; we're in great shape.
13:36.960  ; The problem occurs when people from the natural sciences
13:41.080  ; begin to pontificate about ethics,
13:43.360  ; and people from religion begin to pontificate
13:46.200  ; about natural law.
13:47.880  ; That's where we get into big trouble.
13:50.800  ; You think they're fundamentally distinct,
13:53.720  ; morality and ethics and our idea of what is right
13:58.360  ; and what is wrong.
13:59.360  ; That's something that's outside the reach
14:02.080  ; of string theory and physics.
14:03.960  ; That's right.
14:04.800  ; If you talk to a squirrel about what is right
14:08.680  ; and what is wrong, there's no reference frame
14:12.520  ; for a squirrel, and realize that aliens from outer space,
14:16.600  ; if they ever come visit us, they'll try to talk to us
14:20.560  ; like we talk to squirrels in the forest,
14:22.520  ; but eventually we get bored talking to the squirrels
14:25.880  ; because they don't talk back to us.
14:28.040  ; Same thing with aliens from outer space.
14:30.000  ; They come down to earth, they'll be curious about us
14:32.280  ; to a degree, but after a while they just get bored
14:35.440  ; because we have nothing to offer them.
14:37.920  ; So our sense of right and wrong,
14:40.480  ; what does that mean compared to a squirrel's sense
14:43.400  ; of right and wrong?
14:46.560  ; Now we of course do have an ethics
14:48.720  ; that keeps civilizations in line,
14:51.840  ; enriches our life and makes civilization possible.
14:56.480  ; And I think that's a good thing,
14:58.040  ; but it's not mandated by a law of physics.
15:01.560  ; So if aliens do, alien species were to make contact,
15:06.960  ; forgive me for staying on aliens for a bit longer.
15:10.920  ; Do you think they're more likely to be friendly,
15:15.640  ; to befriend us or to destroy us?
15:18.680  ; Well, I think for the most part,
15:20.560  ; they'll pretty much ignore us.
15:22.880  ; If you're a deer in the forest, who do you fear the most?
15:25.920  ; Do you fear the hunter with his gigantic 16 gauge shotgun?
15:30.480  ; Or do you fear the guy with a briefcase and glasses?
15:35.400  ; Well, the guy with the briefcase could be a developer
15:39.040  ; about to basically flatten the entire forest,
15:42.400  ; destroying your livelihood.
15:44.200  ; So instinctively you may be afraid of the hunter,
15:47.720  ; but actually the problem with deers in the forest
15:51.320  ; is that they should fear developers
15:54.160  ; because developers look at deer as simply
15:57.360  ; getting in the way.
15:59.440  ; I mean, in War of the Worlds by H.G. Wells,
16:02.560  ; the aliens did not hate us.
16:04.760  ; If you read the book,
16:05.960  ; the aliens did not have evil intentions toward homo sapiens.
16:11.360  ; No, we were in the way.
16:13.560  ; So I think we have to realize that alien civilizations
16:18.000  ; may view us quite differently than in science fiction novels.
16:21.080  ; However, I personally believe,
16:22.800  ; and I cannot prove any of this,
16:24.560  ; I personally believe that they're probably gonna be peaceful
16:27.320  ; because there's nothing that they want from our world.
16:31.720  ; I mean, what are they gonna take us?
16:33.360  ; What are they gonna take us for, gold?
16:35.360  ; No, gold is a useless metal for the most part.
16:39.360  ; It's silver, I mean, it's gold in color,
16:43.600  ; but that only affects homo sapiens.
16:45.640  ; Squirrels don't care about gold.
16:47.760  ; And so gold is a rather useless element.
16:50.560  ; Rare earths maybe, platinum based elements,
16:53.160  ; rare earths for the electronics, yeah, maybe.
16:55.720  ; But other than that, we have nothing to offer them.
16:59.280  ; I mean, think about it for a moment.
17:01.640  ; People love Shakespeare and they love the arts and poetry,
17:06.560  ; but outside of the earth, they mean nothing,
17:10.200  ; absolutely nothing.
17:12.320  ; I mean, when I write down an equation in string theory,
17:15.800  ; I would hope that on the other side of the galaxy,
17:19.760  ; there's an alien writing down that very same equation
17:22.880  ; in different notation,
17:24.720  ; but that alien on the other side of the galaxy,
17:27.240  ; Shakespeare, poetry, Hemingway,
17:30.360  ; it would mean nothing to him or her or it.
17:33.960  ; When you think about entities that's out there,
17:38.080  ; extraterrestrial, do you think they would naturally look
17:43.880  ; something that even is recognizable to us as life?
17:48.000  ; Or would they be radically different?
17:50.560  ; Well, how did we become intelligent?
17:52.840  ; Basically three things made us intelligent.
17:56.160  ; One is our eyesight, stereo eyesight.
17:59.320  ; We have the eyes of a hunter,
18:01.160  ; stereo vision so we lock in on targets.
18:04.240  ; And who is smarter, predator or prey?
18:09.360  ; Predators are smarter than prey.
18:11.560  ; They have their eyes at the front of their face,
18:13.240  ; like lions, tigers,
18:15.680  ; while rabbits have eyes to the side of their face.
18:18.800  ; Why is that?
18:19.840  ; Hunters have to zero in on the target.
18:22.720  ; They have to know how to ambush.
18:24.560  ; They have to know how to hide, camouflage,
18:27.000  ; sneak up, stealth, deceit.
18:30.160  ; That takes a lot of intelligence.
18:31.960  ; Rabbits, all they have to do is run.
18:35.200  ; So that's the first criterion, stereo eyesight of some sort.
18:39.880  ; Second is the thumb.
18:42.760  ; The opposable thumb of some sort
18:44.640  ; could be a claw or a tentacle.
18:46.120  ; So hand eye coordination.
18:48.640  ; Hand eye coordination is the way
18:50.240  ; we manipulate the environment.
18:52.800  ; And then three, language.
18:55.040  ; Because mama bear never tells baby bear
18:58.200  ; to avoid the human hunter.
19:00.360  ; Bears just learn by themselves.
19:02.360  ; They never hand out information
19:04.040  ; from one generation to the next.
19:06.240  ; So these are the three basic ingredients of intelligence.
19:10.200  ; Eyesight of some sort, an opposable thumb
19:12.960  ; or tentacle or claw of some sort, and language.
19:16.640  ; Now ask yourself a simple question.
19:19.080  ; How many animals have all three?
19:22.400  ; Just us.
19:23.480  ; It's just us.
19:25.200  ; I mean, the primates, they have a language, yeah,
19:28.440  ; they may get up to maybe 20 words,
19:30.720  ; but a baby learns a word a day,
19:32.720  ; several words a day a baby learns.
19:35.120  ; And a typical adult knows about almost 5,000 words.
19:41.000  ; While the maximum number of words
19:42.800  ; that you can teach a gorilla in any language,
19:46.600  ; including their own language, is about 20 or so.
19:49.680  ; And so we see the difference in intelligence.
19:53.080  ; So when we meet aliens from outer space,
19:55.560  ; chances are they will have been descended
19:58.040  ; from predators of some sort.
20:01.040  ; They'll have some way to manipulate the environment
20:03.440  ; and communicate their knowledge to the next generation.
20:07.840  ; That's it, folks.
20:09.000  ; So functionally, that would be similar.
20:12.400  ; That would, we would be able to recognize them.
20:15.880  ; Well, not necessarily, because I think
20:17.920  ; even with Homo sapiens, we are eventually
20:20.960  ; going to perhaps become part cybernetic
20:24.760  ; and genetically enhanced.
20:27.960  ; Already, robots are getting smarter and smarter.
20:31.520  ; Right now, robots have the intelligence of a cockroach.
20:35.720  ; But in the coming years,
20:37.280  ; our robots will be as smart as a mouse,
20:40.480  ; then maybe as smart as a rabbit.
20:42.840  ; If we're lucky, maybe as smart as a cat or a dog.
20:47.200  ; And by the end of the century, who knows for sure,
20:50.200  ; our robots will be probably as smart as a monkey.
20:53.680  ; Now, at that point, of course, they could be dangerous.
20:56.960  ; You see, monkeys are self aware.
20:59.720  ; They know they are monkeys.
21:03.320  ; They may have a different agenda than us.
21:06.160  ; While dogs, dogs are confused.
21:10.600  ; You see, dogs think that we are a dog,
21:14.760  ; that we're the top dog.
21:16.360  ; They're the underdog.
21:17.480  ; That's why they whimper and follow us and lick us
21:20.200  ; all the time.
21:21.320  ; We're the top dog.
21:22.920  ; Monkeys have no illusion at all.
21:25.440  ; They know we are not monkeys.
21:28.280  ; And so I think that in the future,
21:29.960  ; we'll have to put a chip in their brain to shut them off
21:32.960  ; once our robots have murderous thoughts.
21:35.480  ; But that's in a hundred years.
21:37.480  ; In 200 years, the robots will be smart enough
21:41.520  ; to remove that fail safe chip in their brain
21:44.640  ; and then watch out.
21:46.840  ; At that point, I think rather than compete with our robots,
21:52.600  ; we should merge with them.
21:54.800  ; We should become part cybernetic.
21:56.800  ; So I think when we meet alien life from outer space,
21:59.480  ; they may be genetically and cybernetically enhanced.
22:05.360  ; Genetically and cybernetically enhanced.
22:07.720  ; Wow, so let's talk about that full range.
22:11.040  ; In the near term and 200 years from now,
22:13.720  ; how promising in the near term in your view
22:16.920  ; is brain machine interfaces?
22:18.760  ; So starting to allow computers to talk directly
22:22.920  ; to the brains, Elon Musk is working on that with Neuralink
22:26.880  ; and there's other companies working on this idea.
22:29.000  ; Do you see promise there?
22:30.480  ; Do you see hope for near term impact?
22:32.960  ; Well, every technology has pluses and minuses.
22:36.400  ; Already we can record memories.
22:38.600  ; I have a book, The Future of the Mind,
22:40.920  ; where I detail some of these breakthroughs.
22:42.840  ; We can now record simple memories of mice
22:46.360  ; and send these memories on the internet.
22:49.320  ; Eventually, we're gonna do this with primates
22:52.080  ; at Wake Forest University and also in Los Angeles.
22:55.960  ; And then after that,
22:57.720  ; we'll have a memory chip for Alzheimer's patients.
23:00.880  ; We'll test it out in Alzheimer's patients
23:02.840  ; because of course, when Alzheimer's patients
23:05.800  ; lose their memory, they wander.
23:07.760  ; They create all sorts of havoc, wandering around,
23:11.680  ; oblivious to their surroundings and they'll have a chip.
23:15.640  ; They'll push the button and memories,
23:18.240  ; memories will come flooding into their hippocampus
23:21.120  ; and the chip telling them where they live and who they are.
23:26.280  ; And so a memory chip is definitely in the cards.
23:29.520  ; And I think this will eventually affect human civilization.
23:33.200  ; What is the future of the internet?
23:35.080  ; The future of the internet is brain net.
23:37.680  ; Brain net is when we send emotions, feelings,
23:41.680  ; sensations on the internet.
23:44.400  ; And we will telepathically communicate
23:46.640  ; with other humans this way.
23:49.600  ; This is gonna affect everything.
23:51.160  ; Look at entertainment.
23:52.480  ; Remember the silent movies?
23:54.080  ; Charlie Chaplin was very famous
23:56.240  ; during the era of silent movies.
23:58.040  ; But when the talkies came in,
23:59.960  ; nobody wanted to see Charlie Chaplin anymore
24:03.000  ; because he never talked in the movies.
24:05.640  ; And so a whole generation of actors lost their job
24:08.880  ; and a new series of actors came in.
24:11.400  ; Next, we're gonna have the movies replaced by brain net
24:16.960  ; because in the future, people will say,
24:19.480  ; who wants to see a screen with images?
24:23.120  ; That's it.
24:23.960  ; Sound and image, that's called the movies.
24:27.320  ; In our entertainment industry,
24:28.960  ; this multi billion dollar industry is based on screens
24:32.240  ; with moving images and sound.
24:34.680  ; But what happens when emotions, feelings, sensations,
24:39.920  ; memories can be conveyed on the internet?
24:43.200  ; It's gonna change everything.
24:44.800  ; Human relations will change
24:46.280  ; because you'll be able to empathize
24:47.720  ; and feel the suffering of other people.
24:50.280  ; We'll be able to communicate telepathically.
24:53.280  ; And this is coming.
24:55.880  ; You described brain net and future of the mind.
24:58.640  ; This is an interesting concept.
25:00.960  ; Do you think, so you mentioned entertainment,
25:03.920  ; but what kind of effect would it have
25:06.200  ; on our personal relationships?
25:08.600  ; Hopefully it will deepen it.
25:10.360  ; You realize that for most of human history,
25:13.360  ; for over 90% of human history,
25:16.760  ; we only knew maybe 20, 100 people.
25:22.040  ; That's it, folks.
25:23.520  ; That was your tribe.
25:25.000  ; That was everybody you knew in the universe
25:28.400  ; was only maybe 50 or 100.
25:31.720  ; With the coming of towns,
25:33.240  ; of course it expanded to a few thousand.
25:35.640  ; With the coming of the telephone,
25:37.480  ; all of a sudden you could reach thousands of people
25:40.520  ; with a telephone.
25:41.600  ; And now with the internet,
25:42.680  ; you can reach the entire population of the planet Earth.
25:45.520  ; And so I think this is a normal progression.
25:48.400  ; And you think that kind of sort of connection
25:52.320  ; to the rest of the world,
25:53.920  ; and then adding sensations
25:55.360  ; like being able to share telepathically emotions and so on
25:58.880  ; that would just further deepen our connection
26:01.160  ; to our fellow humans.
26:02.920  ; That's right.
26:03.760  ; In fact, I disagree with many scientists on this question.
26:07.680  ; Most scientists would say that technology is neutral.
26:11.200  ; A double edged sword,
26:12.600  ; one side of the sword can cut against people.
26:15.960  ; The other side of the sword
26:17.360  ; can cut against ignorance and disease.
26:20.840  ; I disagree.
26:22.440  ; I think technology does have a moral direction.
26:25.920  ; Look at the internet.
26:27.360  ; The internet spreads knowledge, awareness,
26:30.680  ; and that creates empowerment.
26:33.040  ; People act on knowledge.
26:35.400  ; When they begin to realize
26:36.760  ; that they don't have to live that way,
26:38.520  ; they don't have to suffer under a dictatorship,
26:41.080  ; that there are other ways of living under freedom,
26:44.560  ; then they begin to take things, take power.
26:47.720  ; And that spreads democracy.
26:49.600  ; And democracies do not war with other democracies.
26:54.240  ; I'm a scientist.
26:55.240  ; I believe in data.
26:57.160  ; So let's take a sheet of paper
26:59.080  ; and write down every single war you had to learn
27:03.760  ; since you were in elementary school.
27:05.880  ; Every single war, hundreds of them.
27:07.800  ; Kings, queens, emperors, dictators.
27:11.040  ; All these wars were between kings, queens,
27:13.600  ; emperors, and dictators.
27:15.240  ; Never between two major democracies.
27:19.840  ; And so I think with the spread of this technology
27:22.560  ; and which would accelerate with the coming of brain net,
27:26.120  ; it means that, well, we will still have wars.
27:28.480  ; Wars, of course, is politics by other means,
27:31.520  ; but they'll be less intense and less frequent.
27:35.440  ; Do you have worries of longer term existential risk
27:40.960  ; from technology, from AI?
27:43.440  ; So I think that's a wonderful vision of a future
27:48.120  ; where war is a distant memory,
27:51.200  ; but now there's another agent.
27:53.840  ; There's somebody else that's able to create conflict,
27:57.920  ; that's able to create harm, AI systems.
28:00.920  ; So do you have worry about such AI systems?
28:03.080  ; Well, yes, that is an existential risk,
28:05.440  ; but again, I think an existential risk,
28:07.760  ; not for this century.
28:09.800  ; I think our grandkids are gonna have to confront
28:12.520  ; this question as robots gradually approach
28:15.160  ; the intelligence of a dog, a cat,
28:17.840  ; and finally that of a monkey.
28:20.440  ; However, I think we will digitize ourselves as well.
28:23.760  ; Not only are we gonna merge with our technology,
28:26.160  ; we'll also digitize our personality,
28:28.560  ; our memories, our feelings.
28:30.680  ; You realize during the Middle Ages,
28:32.560  ; there was something called dualism.
28:34.680  ; Dualism meant that the soul was separate from the body.
28:38.200  ; When the body died, the soul went to heaven.
28:40.920  ; That's dualism.
28:42.440  ; Then in the 20th century, neuroscience came in
28:45.440  ; and said, bah, humbug.
28:47.720  ; Every time we look at the brain, it's just neurons.
28:50.920  ; That's it, folks, period, end of story.
28:54.640  ; Bunch of neurons firing.
28:56.840  ; Now we're going back to dualism.
28:59.640  ; Now we realize that we can digitize human memories,
29:03.440  ; feelings, sensations, and create a digital copy of ourselves,
29:09.040  ; and that's called the Connectome Project.
29:11.600  ; Billions of dollars are now being spent
29:14.320  ; to do not just the genome project
29:17.320  ; of sequencing the genes of our body,
29:19.680  ; but the Connectome Project,
29:21.640  ; which is to map the entire connections of the human brain.
29:26.120  ; And even before then, already in Silicon Valley,
29:28.920  ; today, at this very moment,
29:31.320  ; you can contact Silicon Valley companies
29:33.480  ; that are willing to digitize your relatives
29:36.800  ; because some people want to talk to their parents.
29:39.760  ; There are unresolved issues with their parents,
29:42.400  ; and one day, yes, firms will digitize people,
29:45.800  ; and you'll be able to talk to them a reasonable facsimile.
29:49.280  ; We leave a digital trail.
29:52.440  ; Our ancestors did not.
29:54.080  ; Our ancestors were lucky if they had one line,
29:57.600  ; just one line in a church book,
30:00.720  ; saying the date they were baptized and the date they died.
30:04.400  ; That's it.
30:05.280  ; That was their entire digital memory.
30:08.200  ; I mean, their entire digital existence summarized
30:11.520  ; in just a few letters of the alphabet, a whole life.
30:15.960  ; Now we digitize everything.
30:17.960  ; Every time you sneeze, you digitize it.
30:20.320  ; You put it on the internet.
30:22.800  ; And so I think that we are gonna digitize ourselves
30:25.440  ; and give us digital immortality.
30:28.000  ; We'll not only have biologic genetic immortality
30:31.280  ; of some sort, but also digital immortality.
30:34.880  ; And what are we gonna do with it?
30:37.080  ; I think we should send it into outer space.
30:40.880  ; If you digitize the human brain
30:43.080  ; and put it on a laser beam and shoot it to the moon,
30:46.600  ; you're on the moon in one second.
30:48.840  ; Shoot it to Mars, you're on Mars in 20 minutes.
30:51.960  ; Shoot it to Pluto, you're on Pluto in eight hours.
30:54.800  ; Think about it for a moment.
30:56.160  ; You can have breakfast in New York
30:58.480  ; and for a morning snack, vacation on the moon,
31:02.000  ; then zap your way to Mars by noontime,
31:05.560  ; journey through the asteroid belt of the afternoon,
31:08.520  ; and then come back for dinner in New York at night.
31:11.960  ; All in a day's work at the speed of light.
31:16.120  ; Now, this means that you don't need booster rockets.
31:19.680  ; You don't need weightlessness problems.
31:21.720  ; You don't need to worry about meteorites.
31:23.760  ; And what's on the moon?
31:25.320  ; On the moon, there is a mainframe
31:27.360  ; that downloads your laser beam's information.
31:31.080  ; And where does it download the information into?
31:34.000  ; An avatar.
31:35.760  ; Now, what does that avatar look like?
31:37.800  ; Anything you want.
31:40.960  ; Think about it for a moment.
31:41.920  ; You could be Superman, Superwoman, on the moon, on Mars,
31:47.400  ; traveling throughout the universe at the speed of light,
31:50.840  ; downloading your personality into any vehicle you want.
31:55.240  ; Now, let me stick my neck out.
31:57.200  ; So far, everything I've been saying
31:58.960  ; is well within the laws of physics.
32:00.800  ; Well within the laws of physics.
32:02.480  ; Now, let me go outside the laws of physics again.
32:04.760  ; Here we go.
32:05.920  ; I think this already exists.
32:08.840  ; I think outside the Earth, there could be a super highway
32:11.880  ; a laser highway of laser porting
32:14.760  ; with billions of souls of aliens
32:17.560  ; zapping their way across the galaxy.
32:20.880  ; Now, let me ask you a question.
32:22.680  ; Are we smart enough to determine
32:25.280  ; whether such a thing exists or not?
32:28.280  ; No, this could exist right outside
32:31.200  ; the orbit of the planet Earth.
32:32.960  ; And we're too stupid in our technology
32:35.680  ; to even prove it or disprove it.
32:38.760  ; We would need the aliens on this laser super highway
32:43.520  ; to help us out, to send us a human interpretable signal.
32:50.640  ; I mean, it ultimately boils down
32:51.920  ; to the language of communication,
32:53.320  ; but that's an exciting possibility
32:55.000  ; that actually the sky is filled with aliens.
32:59.080  ; The aliens could already be here.
33:00.760  ; And we're just so oblivious that we're too stupid to know it.
33:05.360  ; See, they don't have to be in alien form
33:07.280  ; with little green men.
33:09.720  ; They can be in any form they want
33:11.480  ; in an avatar of their creation.
33:13.280  ; Well, in fact, they could very well be.
33:16.240  ; They can even look like us.
33:17.320  ; Exactly.
33:18.160  ; We'd never know.
33:19.000  ; One of us could be an alien.
33:21.240  ; You know, in the zoo, did you know
33:22.720  ; that we sometimes have zookeepers that imitate animals?
33:26.360  ; We create a fake animal and we put it in
33:29.240  ; so that the animal is not afraid of this fake animal.
33:33.480  ; And of course, these animals brains,
33:35.080  ; their brain is about as big as a walnut.
33:37.080  ; They accept these dummies as if they were real.
33:41.680  ; So an alien civilization in outer space would say,
33:44.160  ; oh yeah, human brains are so tiny.
33:46.480  ; We could put a dummy on their world, an avatar,
33:49.240  ; and they'd never know it.
33:51.680  ; That would be an entertaining thing to watch
33:53.400  ; from the alien perspective.
33:55.040  ; So you kind of implied that with a digital form
33:58.880  ; of our being, but also biologically,
34:02.280  ; do you think one day technology will allow
34:04.560  ; individual human beings to become immortal
34:07.600  ; besides just through the ability to digitize our essence?
34:11.560  ; Yeah, I think that artificial intelligence
34:13.640  ; will give us the key to genetic immortality.
34:17.160  ; You see, in the coming decades,
34:18.880  ; everyone's gonna have their gene sequence.
34:21.280  ; We'll have billions of genomes of old people,
34:24.160  ; billions of genomes of young people.
34:26.760  ; And what are we gonna do with it?
34:28.200  ; We're gonna run it through an AI machine,
34:30.120  ; which has pattern recognition, to look for the age genes.
34:35.080  ; In other words, the fountain of youth that emperors,
34:38.480  ; kings, and queens lusted over.
34:41.920  ; The fountain of youth will be found
34:44.040  ; by artificial intelligence.
34:46.160  ; Artificial intelligence will identify
34:48.800  ; where these age genes are located.
34:52.200  ; First of all, what is aging?
34:53.800  ; We now know what aging is.
34:55.840  ; Aging is the buildup of errors.
34:59.680  ; That's all aging is, the buildup of genetic errors.
35:03.560  ; This means that cells eventually become slower, sluggish,
35:07.360  ; they go into senescence, and they die.
35:10.480  ; In fact, that's why we die.
35:13.720  ; We die because of the buildup of mistakes
35:16.840  ; in our genome, in our cellular activity.
35:20.720  ; But you see, in the future, we'll be able to fix those genes
35:23.120  ; with CRISPR type technologies,
35:25.440  ; and perhaps even live forever.
35:27.400  ; So let me ask you a question.
35:29.160  ; Where does aging take place in a car?
35:32.120  ; Given a car, where does aging take place?
35:34.640  ; Well, it's obvious, the engine, right?
35:37.520  ; A, that's where you have a lot of moving parts.
35:39.960  ; B, that's where you have combustion.
35:41.760  ; Well, where in the cell do we have combustion?
35:47.160  ; The mitochondria.
35:48.760  ; We now know where aging takes place.
35:52.000  ; And if we cure many of the mistakes that build up
35:55.000  ; in the mitochondria of the cell, we could become immortal.
35:59.360  ; Let me ask you, if you yourself could become immortal,
36:03.400  ; would you?
36:06.280  ; Damn straight.
36:07.120  ; No, I think about it for a while,
36:10.280  ; because of course, it depends on how you become immortal.
36:14.880  ; You know, there's a famous myth of Tithonus.
36:17.560  ; It turns out that years ago, in the Greek mythology,
36:21.640  ; there was the saga of Tithonus and Aurora.
36:25.280  ; Aurora was the goddess of the dawn,
36:28.360  ; and she fell in love with a mortal, a human called Tithonus.
36:32.120  ; And so Aurora begged Zeus to grant her
36:37.440  ; the gift of immortality to give to her lover.
36:42.240  ; So Zeus took pity on Aurora and made Tithonus immortal.
36:47.080  ; But you see, Aurora made a mistake,
36:49.600  ; a huge mistake.
36:52.440  ; She asked for immortality,
36:54.800  ; but she forgot to ask for eternal youth.
36:59.160  ; So poor Tithonus got older and older and older every year,
37:03.520  ; decrepit, a bag of bones, but he could never die.
37:08.600  ; Never die.
37:09.440  ; Quality of life is important.
37:11.600  ; So I think immortality is a great idea,
37:14.640  ; as long as you also have immortal youth as well.
37:18.120  ; Now, I personally believe, and I cannot prove this,
37:20.800  ; but I personally believe that our grandkids
37:22.680  ; may have the option of reaching the age of 30
37:26.200  ; and then stopping.
37:28.240  ; They may like being age 30,
37:30.880  ; because you have wisdom,
37:32.400  ; you have all the benefits of age and maturity,
37:35.720  ; and you still live forever with a healthy body.
37:39.280  ; Our descendants may like being 30 for several centuries.
37:43.240  ; Is there an aspect of human existence
37:45.280  ; that is meaningful only because we're mortal?
37:49.520  ; Well, every waking moment,
37:52.120  ; we don't think about it this way,
37:53.880  ; but every waking moment,
37:55.200  ; actually, we are aware of our death and our mortality.
38:00.240  ; Think about it for a moment.
38:01.280  ; When you go to college,
38:03.320  ; you realize that you are in a period of time
38:05.880  ; where soon you will reach middle age and have a career.
38:10.320  ; And after that, you'll retire and then you'll die.
38:13.840  ; And so even as a youth, even as a child,
38:17.280  ; without even thinking about it,
38:19.560  ; you are aware of your own death,
38:21.840  ; because it sets limits to your lifespan.
38:24.680  ; I gotta graduate from high school.
38:26.240  ; I gotta graduate from college.
38:27.840  ; Why?
38:28.880  ; Because you're gonna die.
38:30.320  ; Because unless you graduate from high school,
38:32.920  ; unless you graduate from college,
38:34.640  ; you're not gonna enter old age with enough money
38:37.280  ; to retire and then die.
38:39.480  ; And so, yeah, people think about it unconsciously,
38:42.640  ; because it affects every aspect of your being.
38:46.920  ; The fact that you go to high school, college,
38:49.240  ; get married, have kids, there's a clock,
38:52.240  ; a clock ticking even without your permission.
38:56.600  ; It gives a sense of urgency.
38:58.160  ; Do you yourself, I mean,
39:01.040  ; there's so much excitement and passion
39:03.000  ; in the way you talk about physics
39:04.520  ; and the way you talk about technology in the future.
39:07.960  ; Do you yourself meditate on your own mortality?
39:11.400  ; Do you think about this clock that's ticking?
39:14.600  ; Well, I try not to,
39:15.800  ; because it then begins to affect your behavior.
39:19.600  ; You begin to alter your behavior
39:21.960  ; to match your expectation of when you're gonna die.
39:26.280  ; So let's talk about youth,
39:27.880  ; and then let's talk about death, okay?
39:31.040  ; When I interview scientists on radio,
39:34.840  ; I often ask them, what made the difference?
39:37.960  ; How old were you?
39:39.400  ; What changed your life?
39:41.920  ; And they always say more or less the same thing.
39:44.080  ; No, these are Nobel Prize winners,
39:45.600  ; directors of major laboratories,
39:47.040  ; very distinguished scientists.
39:48.800  ; They always say, when I was 10,
39:52.960  ; when I was 10, something happened.
39:55.480  ; It was a visit to the planetarium.
39:57.720  ; It was a telescope.
39:59.400  ; For Steven Weinberg, winner of the Nobel Prize,
40:01.920  ; it was the chemistry kit.
40:03.840  ; For Heinz Pagels, it was a visit to the planetarium.
40:07.240  ; For Isidor Rabi, it was a book about the planets.
40:10.880  ; For Albert Einstein, it was a compass.
40:14.120  ; Something happened,
40:15.560  ; which gives them this existential shock.
40:18.840  ; Because you see, before the age of 10,
40:20.440  ; everything is mommy and daddy, mommy and dad.
40:22.520  ; That's your universe, mommy and daddy.
40:25.000  ; Around the age of 10, you begin to wonder,
40:27.480  ; what's beyond mommy and daddy?
40:30.680  ; And that's when you have this epiphany,
40:33.560  ; when you realize, oh my God, there's a universe out there,
40:38.880  ; a universe of discovery.
40:40.360  ; And that sensation stays with you for the rest of your life.
40:45.520  ; You still remember that shock
40:47.880  ; that you felt gazing at the universe.
40:50.800  ; And then you hit the greatest destroyer of scientists
40:55.440  ; known to science.
40:57.560  ; The greatest destroyer of scientists known to science
41:02.480  ; is junior high school.
41:05.560  ; When you hit junior high school, folks, it's all over.
41:08.840  ; It's all over.
41:10.720  ; Because in junior high school, people say, hey, stupid.
41:14.640  ; I mean, you like that nerdy stuff.
41:17.600  ; And your friends shun you.
41:19.800  ; All of a sudden, people think you're a weirdo.
41:22.560  ; And scientists made boring.
41:25.640  ; Richard Feynman, the Nobel Prize winner,
41:27.440  ; when he was a child,
41:29.000  ; his father would take him into the forest.
41:31.520  ; And the father would teach him everything about birds,
41:35.080  ; why they're shaped the way they are,
41:36.960  ; their wings, the coloration, the shape of their beak,
41:40.520  ; everything about birds.
41:43.080  ; So one day, a bully comes up
41:44.440  ; to the future Nobel Prize winner and says,
41:47.000  ; hey, Dick, what's the name of that bird over there?
41:51.360  ; Well, he didn't know.
41:53.040  ; He knew everything about that bird except its name.
41:58.760  ; So he said, I don't know.
42:00.960  ; And then the bully said, what's the matter, Dick?
42:03.080  ; You stupid or something?
42:05.200  ; And then in that instant, he got it.
42:08.720  ; He got it.
42:09.960  ; He realized that for most people,
42:12.040  ; science is giving names to birds.
42:15.960  ; That's what science is.
42:17.480  ; You know lots of names of obscure things.
42:19.800  ; Hey, people say, you're smart.
42:21.720  ; You're smart.
42:22.800  ; You know all the names of the dinosaurs.
42:24.640  ; You know all the names of the plants.
42:26.560  ; No, that's not science at all.
42:29.880  ; Science is about principles, concepts, physical pictures.
42:36.440  ; That's what science is all about.
42:38.560  ; My favorite quote from Einstein is that,
42:41.600  ; unless you can explain the theory to a child,
42:44.720  ; the theory is probably worthless.
42:47.800  ; Meaning that all great theories are not big words.
42:52.720  ; All great theories are simple concepts, principles,
42:57.520  ; basic physical pictures.
43:00.440  ; Relativity is all about clocks, meter sticks,
43:04.480  ; rocket ships and locomotives.
43:07.160  ; Newton's laws of gravity are all about balls
43:10.040  ; and spinning wheels and things like that.
43:13.160  ; That's what physics and science is all about,
43:15.760  ; not memorizing things.
43:17.480  ; And that stays with you for the rest of your life.
43:20.840  ; So even in old age, I've noticed that these scientists,
43:24.600  ; when they sit back, they still remember.
43:28.000  ; They still remember that flush,
43:30.480  ; that flush of excitement they felt with that first telescope,
43:34.880  ; that first moment when they encountered the universe.
43:38.640  ; That keeps them going.
43:40.040  ; That keeps them going.
43:42.800  ; By the way, I should point out that when I was eight,
43:46.200  ; something happened to me as well.
43:49.240  ; When I was eight years old, it was in all the papers
43:53.680  ; that a great scientist had just died.
43:56.720  ; And they put a picture of his desk on the front page.
44:00.760  ; That's it, just a simple picture of the front page
44:03.920  ; of the newspapers of his desk.
44:06.200  ; That desk had a book on it, which was opened.
44:09.120  ; And the caption said more or less,
44:11.400  ; this is the unfinished manuscript
44:14.200  ; from the greatest scientists of our time.
44:17.520  ; So I said to myself, well, why couldn't he finish it?
44:22.160  ; What's so hard that you can't finish it
44:25.720  ; if you're a great scientist?
44:26.840  ; It's a homework problem, right?
44:28.880  ; You go home, you solve it, or you ask your mom,
44:32.000  ; why couldn't he solve it?
44:33.680  ; So to me, this was a murder mystery.
44:35.520  ; This was greater than any adventure story.
44:37.800  ; I had to know why the greatest scientists of our time
44:41.000  ; couldn't finish something.
44:43.160  ; And then over the years, I found out the guy had a name,
44:46.480  ; Albert Einstein, and that book was The Theory of Everything.
44:51.480  ; It was unfinished.
44:53.080  ; Well, today I can read that book.
44:55.760  ; I can see all the dead ends and false starts that he made.
44:59.320  ; And I began to realize that he lost his way
45:02.120  ; because he didn't have a physical picture
45:05.920  ; to guide him on the third try.
45:09.400  ; On the first try, he talked about clocks
45:12.560  ; and lightning bolts and meter sticks,
45:15.040  ; and that gave us special relativity,
45:17.280  ; which gave us the atomic bomb.
45:19.840  ; The second great picture was gravity
45:23.040  ; with balls rolling on curved surfaces.
45:26.320  ; And that gave us the Big Bang,
45:28.200  ; creation of the universe, black holes.
45:30.960  ; On the third try, he missed it.
45:34.200  ; He had no picture at all to guide him.
45:38.120  ; In fact, there's a quote I have where he said,
45:40.160  ; I'm still looking.
45:41.600  ; I'm still looking for that picture.
45:44.280  ; He never found it.
45:45.800  ; Well, today we think that picture is strength theory.
45:49.320  ; The strength theory can unify gravity
45:52.240  ; and this mysterious thing that Einstein didn't like,
45:54.720  ; which is quantum mechanics,
45:55.840  ; or couldn't quite pin down and make sense of.
45:59.240  ; That's right.
46:00.080  ; Mother nature has two hands, a left hand and a right hand.
46:02.880  ; The left hand is a theory of the small.
46:05.200  ; The right hand is a theory of the big.
46:07.720  ; The theory of the small is the quantum theory,
46:09.880  ; the theory of atoms and quarks.
46:11.920  ; The theory of the big is relativity,
46:13.960  ; the theory of black holes, big bangs.
46:16.360  ; The problem is the left hand does not talk to the right hand.
46:22.600  ; They hate each other.
46:24.520  ; The left hand is based on discrete particles.
46:27.400  ; The right hand is based on smooth surfaces.
46:31.080  ; How do you put these two things together
46:33.240  ; into a single theory?
46:34.280  ; They hate each other.
46:35.880  ; The greatest minds of our time,
46:38.200  ; the greatest minds of our time
46:40.200  ; worked on this problem and failed.
46:43.280  ; Today, the only theory that has survived
46:46.720  ; every challenge so far is string theory.
46:49.520  ; That doesn't mean string theory is correct.
46:51.600  ; It could very well be wrong,
46:53.360  ; but right now it's the only game in town.
46:56.240  ; Some people come up to me and say,
46:57.760  ; ''Professor, I don't believe in string theory.
47:00.240  ; Give me an alternative.''
47:02.720  ; And I tell them there is none.
47:05.760  ; Get used to it.
47:07.760  ; It's the best theory we got.
47:09.360  ; It's the only theory we have.
47:10.880  ; It's the only theory we have.
47:13.080  ; Do you see, you know,
47:16.000  ; the strings kind of inspire a view,
47:20.160  ; as did atoms and particles and quarks,
47:23.120  ; but especially strings inspire a view of a universe
47:26.720  ; as a kind of information processing system,
47:29.000  ; as a computer of sorts.
47:31.560  ; Do you see the universe in this way?
47:33.680  ; No.
47:34.960  ; Some people think, in fact,
47:36.320  ; the whole universe is a computer of some sort.
47:39.840  ; And they believe that perhaps everything,
47:42.600  ; therefore, is a simulation.
47:44.040  ; Yes.
47:45.040  ; I don't think so.
47:46.360  ; I don't think that there is a super video game
47:49.320  ; where we are nothing but puppets dancing on the screen
47:52.680  ; and somebody hit the play button
47:54.480  ; and here we are talking about simulations.
47:57.560  ; No.
47:58.480  ; Even Newtonian mechanics says that the weather,
48:02.760  ; the simple weather is so complicated
48:04.840  ; with trillions upon trillions of atoms
48:07.320  ; that it cannot be simulated in a finite amount of time.
48:10.840  ; In other words, the smallest object
48:13.880  ; which can describe the weather
48:17.280  ; and simulate the weather is the weather itself.
48:21.360  ; The smallest object that can simulate a human
48:24.360  ; is the human itself.
48:26.960  ; And if you had quantum mechanics,
48:28.840  ; it becomes almost impossible
48:31.360  ; to simulate it with a conventional computer.
48:34.800  ; This quantum mechanics deals with all possible universes,
48:38.600  ; parallel universes, a multiverse of universes.
48:42.440  ; And so the calculation just spirals out of control.
48:46.640  ; Now, so far, there's only one way
48:49.760  ; where you might be able to argue
48:52.320  ; that the universe is a simulation.
48:54.160  ; And this is still being debated by quantum physicists.
48:58.320  ; It turns out that if you throw the encyclopedia
49:00.520  ; into a black hole, the information is not lost.
49:04.000  ; Eventually it winds up on the surface of the black hole.
49:07.600  ; Now, the surface of the black hole is finite.
49:09.960  ; In fact, you can calculate
49:11.640  ; the maximum amount of information
49:13.520  ; you can store in a black hole.
49:15.640  ; It's a finite number.
49:17.160  ; It's a calculable number, believe it or not.
49:19.720  ; Now, if the universe were made out of black holes,
49:21.720  ; which is the maximum universe you can conceive of,
49:25.000  ; each universe, each black hole
49:27.160  ; has a finite amount of information.
49:29.640  ; Therefore, ergo, da da!
49:32.560  ; Ergo, the total amount of information in a universe
49:37.080  ; is finite.
49:38.880  ; This is mind boggling.
49:40.480  ; This, I consider mind boggling,
49:42.960  ; that all possible universes are countable
49:46.600  ; and all possible universes can be summarized in a number,
49:50.000  ; a number you can write on a sheet of paper,
49:52.040  ; all possible universes, and it's a finite number.
49:55.160  ; Now, it's huge.
49:56.600  ; It's a number beyond human imagination.
49:59.560  ; It's a number based on what is called a Planck length,
50:01.960  ; but it's a number.
50:03.680  ; And so if a computer could ever simulate that number,
50:07.560  ; then the universe would be a simulation.
50:10.080  ; So theoretically, because the amount of information
50:13.960  ; is finite, well, there necessarily must be able
50:18.520  ; to exist a computer.
50:19.880  ; It's just, from an engineering perspective,
50:21.840  ; maybe impossible to build.
50:24.080  ; Yes, no computer can build a universe
50:26.920  ; capable of simulating the entire universe,
50:29.280  ; except the universe itself.
50:31.000  ; So that's your intuition, that our universe
50:34.040  ; is very efficient, and so there's no shortcuts.
50:37.960  ; Right, two reasons why I believe the universe
50:40.040  ; is not a simulation.
50:41.320  ; First, the calculational numbers are just incredible.
50:44.480  ; No finite Turing machine can simulate the universe.
50:48.320  ; And second, why would any super intelligent being
50:52.120  ; simulate humans?
50:54.400  ; If you think about it, most humans are kind of stupid.
50:57.960  ; I mean, we do all sorts of crazy, stupid things, right?
51:01.040  ; And we call it art, we call it humor.
51:03.880  ; We call it human civilization.
51:06.280  ; So why should an advanced civilization
51:08.800  ; go through all that effort just to simulate Saturday Night
51:12.680  ; Live?
51:14.280  ; Well, that's a funny idea, but it's also,
51:16.400  ; do you think it's possible that the act of creation
51:20.200  ; cannot anticipate humans?
51:22.080  ; You simply set the initial conditions
51:23.760  ; and set a bunch of physical laws,
51:26.000  ; and just for the fun of it, see what happens.
51:28.760  ; You launch the thing, so you're not necessarily
51:30.720  ; simulating everything.
51:31.680  ; You're not simulating every little bit in the sense
51:35.320  ; that you could predict what's going to happen,
51:37.720  ; but you set the initial conditions, set the laws,
51:40.960  ; and see what kind of fun stuff happens.
51:43.200  ; Well, in some sense, that's how life got started.
51:46.960  ; In the 1950s, Stanley did what is called
51:50.120  ; the Miller experiment.
51:51.800  ; He put a bunch of hydrogen gas, methane, toxic gases
51:57.800  ; with liquid and a spark in a small glass beaker.
52:02.400  ; And then he just walked away for a few weeks,
52:05.080  ; came back a few weeks later, and bingo.
52:08.480  ; Out of nothing and chaos came amino acids.
52:12.840  ; If he had left it there for a few years,
52:14.960  ; he might have gotten protein, protein molecules for free.
52:19.200  ; That's probably how life got started, as a accident.
52:23.720  ; And if he had left it there for perhaps a few million years,
52:26.960  ; DNA might have formed in that beaker.
52:30.840  ; And so we think that, yeah, DNA, life, all that
52:34.080  ; could have been an accident if you wait long enough.
52:38.480  ; And remember, our universe is roughly 13.8 billion years old.
52:42.560  ; That's plenty of time for lots of random things
52:45.600  ; to happen, including life itself.
52:51.360  ; Yeah, we could be just a beautiful little random moment.
52:56.920  ; And there could be an infinite number
52:59.120  ; of those throughout the history of the universe,
53:02.320  ; many creatures like us.
53:04.640  ; We perhaps are not the epitome of what
53:06.480  ; the universe is created for.
53:07.960  ; Thank God.
53:09.880  ; Let's hope not.
53:11.600  ; Just look around.
53:12.440  ; Yeah.
53:13.640  ; Look to your left, look to your right.
53:16.160  ; When do you think the first human will step foot on Mars?
53:20.400  ; I think it's a good chance in the 2030s
53:23.360  ; that we will be on Mars.
53:25.280  ; In fact, there's no physics reason why we can't do it.
53:29.480  ; It's an engineering problem.
53:31.320  ; It's a very difficult and dangerous engineering problem,
53:34.480  ; but it is an engineering problem.
53:36.600  ; And in my book, Future of Humanity,
53:38.640  ; I even speculate beyond that, that by the end
53:41.880  ; of this century, we'll probably have the first starships.
53:45.720  ; The first starships will not look
53:47.360  ; like the Enterprise at all.
53:49.080  ; They'll probably be small computer chips
53:51.680  ; that are fired by laser beams with parachutes.
53:54.760  ; And like what Stephen Hawking advocated,
53:58.400  ; the Breakthrough Starshot program
54:00.160  ; could send ships to the nearby stars,
54:02.920  ; traveling at 20% the speed of light,
54:05.400  ; reaching Alpha Centauri in about 20 years time.
54:09.080  ; Beyond that, we should have fusion power.
54:12.880  ; Fusion power is, in some sense, one
54:15.880  ; of the ultimate sources of energy, but it's unstable.
54:19.720  ; And we don't have fusion power today.
54:22.600  ; Now, why is that?
54:23.720  ; First of all, stars form almost for free.
54:26.160  ; You get a bunch of gas large enough, it becomes a star.
54:29.560  ; I mean, you don't even have to do anything to it,
54:31.920  ; and it becomes a star.
54:33.480  ; Why is fusion so difficult to put on the Earth?
54:37.440  ; Because in outer space, stars are monopoles.
54:40.120  ; They are pole, single poles that are spherically symmetric.
54:44.880  ; And it's very easy to get spherically symmetric
54:47.400  ; configurations of gas to compress into a star.
54:51.160  ; It just happens naturally all by itself.
54:53.800  ; The problem is magnetism is bipolar.
54:56.800  ; You have a North Pole and a South Pole.
54:59.200  ; And it's like trying to squeeze a long balloon.
55:02.320  ; Take a long balloon and try to squeeze it.
55:04.960  ; You squeeze one side, it bulges out the other side.
55:08.240  ; Well, that's the problem with fusion machines.
55:10.560  ; We use magnetism with a North Pole and a South Pole
55:13.440  ; to squeeze gas, and all sorts of anomalies
55:17.560  ; and horrible configurations can take place
55:20.240  ; because we're not squeezing something uniformly
55:23.440  ; like in a star.
55:24.920  ; Stars, in some sense, are for free.
55:27.200  ; Fusion on the Earth is very difficult.
55:31.120  ; But I think it's inevitable.
55:32.960  ; And it'll eventually give us unlimited power from seawater.
55:37.000  ; So seawater will be the ultimate source of energy
55:39.880  ; for the planet Earth.
55:41.160  ; Why?
55:41.680  ; What's the intuition there?
55:42.760  ; Because we'll extract hydrogen from seawater,
55:45.440  ; burn hydrogen in a fusion reactor
55:47.760  ; to give us unlimited energy without the meltdown,
55:52.200  ; without the nuclear waste.
55:53.960  ; Why do we have meltdowns?
55:55.680  ; We have meltdowns because in the fusion reactors,
55:57.920  ; every time you split the uranium atom, you get nuclear waste.
56:00.760  ; Tons of it.
56:01.720  ; 30 tons of nuclear waste per reactor per year.
56:07.080  ; And it's hot.
56:08.400  ; It's hot for thousands, millions of years.
56:11.200  ; That's why we have meltdowns.
56:13.200  ; But you see, the waste product of a fusion reactor
56:15.680  ; is helium gas.
56:17.480  ; Helium gas is actually commercially valuable.
56:19.880  ; You can make money selling helium gas.
56:22.320  ; And so the waste product of a fusion reactor
56:24.960  ; is helium, not nuclear waste that we find
56:28.600  ; in a commercial fission plant.
56:30.720  ; And that controlling, mastering and controlling fusion
56:34.240  ; allows us to, converts us into a type one,
56:38.320  ; I guess, civilization, right?
56:40.200  ; Yeah, probably the backbone of a type one civilization
56:43.280  ; will be fusion power.
56:45.720  ; We, by the way, are type zero.
56:47.760  ; We don't even rate on this scale.
56:49.600  ; We get our energy from dead plants, for God's sake,
56:52.080  ; oil and coal.
56:53.560  ; But we are about 100 years from being type one.
56:56.320  ; Get a calculator.
56:57.680  ; In fact, Carl Sagan calculated that we
56:59.960  ; are about 0.7, fairly close to a 1.0.
57:05.640  ; For example, what is the internet?
57:08.720  ; The internet is the beginning of the first type one technology
57:12.280  ; to enter into our century.
57:14.080  ; The first planetary technology is the internet.
57:17.400  ; What is the language of type one?
57:19.840  ; On the internet already, English and Mandarin Chinese
57:23.400  ; are the most dominant languages on the internet.
57:26.880  ; And what about the culture?
57:29.360  ; We're seeing a type one sports, soccer, the Olympics,
57:34.560  ; a type one music, youth culture, rock and roll, rap music,
57:38.920  ; type one fashion, Gucci, Chanel, a type one economy,
57:42.920  ; the European Union, NAFTA, what have you.
57:45.600  ; So we're beginning to see the beginnings of a type one
57:49.280  ; culture in a type one civilization.
57:52.200  ; And inevitably, it will spread beyond this planet.
57:56.000  ; So you talked about sending at 20% the speed of light
58:00.680  ; on a chip into Alpha Centauri.
58:04.800  ; But in a slightly nearer term, what
58:07.960  ; do you think about the idea when we still have to send
58:11.120  ; our biological bodies the colonization of planets,
58:15.240  ; colonization of Mars?
58:16.560  ; Do you see us becoming a two planet species ever
58:21.360  ; or anytime soon?
58:23.120  ; Well, just remember the dinosaurs
58:26.320  ; did not have a space program.
58:28.760  ; And that's why they're not here today.
58:30.440  ; How come there are no dinosaurs in this room today?
58:33.640  ; Because they didn't have a space program.
58:35.920  ; We do have a space program, which
58:38.320  ; means that we have an insurance policy.
58:40.760  ; Now, I don't think we should bankrupt the Earth
58:43.080  ; or deplete the Earth to go to Mars.
58:44.840  ; That's too expensive and not practical.
58:47.360  ; But we need a settlement, a settlement on Mars
58:50.560  ; in case something bad happens to the planet Earth.
58:53.640  ; And that means we have to terraform Mars.
58:56.400  ; Now, to terraform Mars, if we could
58:58.600  ; raise the temperature of Mars by six degrees, six degrees,
59:03.600  ; then the polar ice caps begin to melt, releasing water vapor.
59:08.480  ; Water vapor is a greenhouse gas.
59:10.600  ; It causes even more melting of the ice caps.
59:13.400  ; So it becomes a self fulfilling prophecy.
59:17.120  ; It feeds on itself.
59:18.880  ; It becomes autocatalytic.
59:21.240  ; And so once you hit six degrees, rising
59:24.040  ; of the temperature on Mars by six degrees, it takes off.
59:27.200  ; And we melt the polar ice caps.
59:29.280  ; And liquid water once again flows
59:32.600  ; in the rivers, the canals, the channels,
59:35.840  ; and the oceans of Mars.
59:38.440  ; Mars once had an ocean, we think,
59:39.920  ; about the size of the United States.
59:42.080  ; And so that is a possibility.
59:44.320  ; Now, how do we get there?
59:46.040  ; How do we raise the temperature of Mars by six degrees?
59:49.040  ; Elon Musk would like to detonate hydrogen warheads
59:51.680  ; on the polar ice caps.
59:53.680  ; Well, I'm not sure about that.
59:56.880  ; Because we don't know that much about the effects
59:59.680  ; of detonating hydrogen warheads to melt the polar ice caps.
1:00:03.520  ; And who wants to glow in the dark at night reading
1:00:05.840  ; the newspaper?
1:00:07.240  ; So I think there are other ways to do it
1:00:09.560  ; with solar satellites.
1:00:12.000  ; You can have satellites orbiting Mars that beam sunlight
1:00:16.080  ; onto the polar ice caps, melting the polar ice caps.
1:00:19.480  ; Mars has plenty of water.
1:00:21.440  ; It's just frozen.
1:00:24.200  ; I think you paint an inspiring and a wonderful picture
1:00:27.880  ; of the future.
1:00:29.760  ; I think you've inspired and educated thousands,
1:00:35.120  ; if not millions.
1:00:36.240  ; Michio, it's been an honor.
1:00:37.400  ; Thank you so much for talking today.
1:00:39.000  ; My pleasure.
